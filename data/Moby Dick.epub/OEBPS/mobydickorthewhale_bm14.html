His physician stitched up his wound, but after the physician left, Cato tore out his stitches and disemboweled himself. Cato did not want to live to be pardoned by Caesar, whom he considered a tyrant and with whose philosophy he violently disagreed.</p>

After his return, Thomas Jefferson suggested that Ledyard explore the American continent by traveling overland through Russia, traversing the Bering Strait, heading south through Alaska, and then crossing the American continent to Virginia. He left London in December 1786 and made it most of the way across Russia before being arrested and eventually deported to Poland. Mungo Park (1771–1806), a Scottish explorer of the African continent, was credited with being the first westerner to encounter the Niger river.

In chapter 56, Melville attributes his own sufferings from swarms of mosquitoes to their introduction by an alleged act of petty vengeance by a Nantucket whaling captain whose name he gives as Nathan Coleman. “When tormented by the musquitoes, I found much relief in coupling the word ‘Coleman’ with another of one syllable, and pronouncing them together energetically.”</p>

Melville is quite correct that the main-truck is much higher than the keelson is low. In a whaleship the size of the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span>, the main-truck could be over one hundred feet in the air, whereas the keelson would lie twelve to fifteen feet below sea level.</p>

Melville’s own ship, the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span>, departed on January 3, 1841. Interestingly, although Melville himself never rounded the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, he has the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> round it in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>. Because of this change of direction, the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> arrives too early in the Pacific Ocean for the “Season-on-the-Line,” the ideal time to hunt whales along the Equator, and therefore heads to whaling grounds near Japan, which whalemen called the “Japan Grounds.”</p>

When Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Japan in 1853, for what has become known as the “opening of Japan,” he was able to speak with the Japanese only because John Manjiro could translate between English and Japanese. In 1841, when Manjiro was fourteen, the fishing vessel on which he was serving was wrecked, and Manjiro was rescued by an American whaleship. The whaleship’s captain carried him to Fairhaven, Massachusetts, where he received an American education and learned to speak English. He returned home to his mother in <a id="page707"/>1852, just before Perry’s arrival. Except for a single Dutch outpost, Japan had been closed to the outside world for two hundred years.</p>

Wampanoags were the first whalemen of Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard.

In the nineteenth century, bankruptcy was often portrayed as bloodlessness. Dough-Boy’s father is both a bankrupt and a baker: he is bloodless, dressed in white, and covered with white flour. His mother is a hospital nurse, so she, too, dresses all in white. Melville contrasts this whiteness with the blackness of the only other boy on board the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>, little Pip.</p>

The “t’gallant cross-trees” occur at the spot where the top-mast and topgallant mast overlap high above the deck of a whaleship. A whaleman stands on the cross-trees and holds tight to the topgallant mast while looking out for whales. The precariousness of this position was made safer in the second half of the nineteenth century, when mast hoops, which encircled the whalemen, were added. Crow’s nests were rarely found on American whaleships outside of the Arctic.</p>

A barrel of whale oil measured 31 gallons; a hogshead measured two barrels or 63 <a id="page709"/>gallons. Whale oil was usually measured in barrels, not gallons. The second Nantucket sailor’s “hogshead mouth ” would be a very large mouth, eminently suitable for loudly calling the watch. See also “tierce” at chapter 110, <span class="bold">e1</span>.</p>

When a sailor’s oar catches in the water, often knocking him off his thwart, or seat, it is referred to as “catching a crab.”</p>

An imperial folio is the largest printed book, an appropriate size in which to discuss the largest of all mammals. Two pages are printed on each sheet of paper for a folio, and four pages for a quarto. Melville states that he has consulted a “ huge quarto edition ” of Johnson’s <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the English Language</span> (1755) in his research because the lexicographer Samuel Johnson (1709–84) was such a large man.</p>

Holes were drilled through the planking and frames of a whaleship, then the treenails were forced into place and wedged at both ends. Treenails were cheaper than iron bolts, but more importantly they did not cause “iron sickness,” the weakening of the wood around an iron bolt that compromised the strength of a ship’s hull.</p>

The log, which can take various forms, is dropped into the water, and the line is then allowed to run out for a specified period of time. Knots are evenly spaced along the line; by counting those knots, the ship’s speed can be determined. Speed is given in “knots,” or nautical miles per hour. A nautical mile is equal to one minute of latitude, or roughly six thousand feet.</p>

Caulkers knew by the sound when they had driven the cotton batting and oakum used to caulk a ship far enough into the seams between the hull or deck planking. Later, the Carpenter says, “This wooden mallet is the cork, and I’m the professor of musical glasses,” tying the music made by the caulking mallet to the music produced on a glass armonica, the musical instrument invented by Benjamin Franklin.</p>
