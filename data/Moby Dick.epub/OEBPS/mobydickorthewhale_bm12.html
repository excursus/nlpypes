<p class="chapterOpenerText">Herman Melville deserted the whaleship <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> at Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands on July 9, 1842. There was nothing unusual in this: desertion was rampant on American whaleships. The average whaling voyage in the mid nineteenth century lasted between two and five years. That is an almost inconceivable amount of time to be away from home and confined within a tiny, cramped space with a crew made up, as Melville writes in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, “of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals” (203). Dark, wet, noisome, and totally lacking in privacy—the forecastle of an American whaleship was a place that most people would not want to inhabit for an hour, much less somewhere between two and five years. In addition, the whalemen never got a full night’s sleep, for they were awoken every four hours to stand a four-hour watch, and rarely had enough food. Mostly, they ate salted meat—beef, pork, and at times less-palatable meat such as horse or worse—and hardtack. Hardtack was a double-baked biscuit that was often full of weevils and so hard it had to be dipped into water, coffee, soup, or stew in order to bite into it. The water drunk by the whalemen was habitually green and full of living creatures. Rum was often added in order to kill some, if not all, of those creatures; such a mixture of rum and water was called grog. But the addition of rum was not an option on the many temperance ships, and so the sailors had to choke down the water, no matter what its state.</p>
<p class="para">With conditions this repulsive, one wonders how a whaleship ever returned home with any of its original crew. Set against the conditions aboard ship, however, were the fears of what the men would find on shore. The sailors’ greatest fear was that the people of the islands they visited would turn out to be cannibals. Yet much as they were repelled by such an idea, they were also fascinated by it.</p>
<p class="para">I have borrowed the term “cannibal talk ” from anthropologist Gananath Obeyesekere. In <span class="italic">Cannibal Talk: The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrifice in the South Seas</span> (2005), Obeyesekere investigates what he calls “dialogical misunderstandings” in the South Seas. Misunderstanding extended in both directions. Europeans believed South Pacific islanders to be cannibals, and the islanders in turn believed Europeans to be cannibals. This misunderstanding resulted in what Obeyesekere calls “cannibal talk,” talk that flowed in both directions.</p>
<p class="para">When Melville deserted the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> at Nuku Hiva, he crossed the beach, both literally and metaphorically, with a set of preconceptions about the identification and nature of cannibals. In <span class="italic">Typee</span>, as the whaleship <span class="italic">Dolly</span> sails along the Nuku Hiva coast, the <a id="page696"/>sailor Ned tells the narrator, “There—there’s Typee. Oh, the bloody cannibals, what a meal they’d make of us” (chapter 4). Sailors <span class="italic">expected</span> to find cannibals in the South Pacific—and so they did.</p>
<p class="para">To be a cannibal is to cross the boundary of what it is to be fully human. Therefore, cannibals are less than human; they are the Other. Historically, cannibals were people living on the edges of the known world—from the Scythians in northern Europe, known to us through the writings of Herodotus and Pliny the Elder, through the Tupinamba of Brazil, about whom Michel de Montaigne wrote “Of Cannibals,” then to the Caribs of the Caribbean, whom Columbus identified as cannibals, and finally to the South Pacific. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, European perception of cannibalism centered on the South Pacific, first on New Zealand and later throughout the South Pacific, but especially Fiji and the Marquesas. Today, in the early twenty-first century, New Guinea reigns in the popular imagination as the last bastion of cannibalism—especially because of the supposed link between ritual cannibalism and kuru, a slow, wasting disease related to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and mad cow disease, found among the Fore people. Kuru is thought by many—although this interpretation has been strongly questioned by others—to be transmitted through the eating of diseased flesh.</p>
<p class="para">In his first book, <span class="italic">Typee</span> (1846), Melville most obviously confronts cannibalism. <span class="italic">Typee</span> is driven by the fear of cannibalism. The protagonist, Tommo, accidentally finds himself in the valley of the Typee people rather than amongst the Happar people. The Typee have a reputation as fierce savages, while the Happar are reputed to be gentle and kind. Despite their ferocious reputation, Tommo finds the Typee to lead Edenic lives, filled with gaiety, plenty of food, and plenty of sleep—all that sailors aboard whaleships lack. Tommo is lulled into this life, but in the back of his mind is the constant fear that one day these happy people will eat him.</p>
<p class="para">Part of what Melville considers in <span class="italic">Typee</span> is what it means to cross the beach: to leave one’s own world and enter another, where no one speaks your language; where the people dress differently, eat different food, interact differently; where the rules by which they live are utterly unknown to you. After a whaleship, the Typee valley looks like Eden to Tommo, but he ultimately breaks away from it, in a fierce and savage manner, to reenter his own world.</p>
<p class="para">In <span class="italic">Typee</span>, Melville begins to consider the savagery inherent in all of us, especially with Tommo’s violence against Mow-Mow, one of the islanders, at the end of the book. By <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> (1851) this consideration has become an understanding that the cannibal is not only the Other but also the shadow of ourselves. Queequeg is a cannibal, Ahab calls himself a cannibal, and the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> is a “cannibal of a craft” (78)—all, all are cannibals. <a id="page697"/>Melville forces us to accept that we must face and even embrace the darkest and most horrific depths of ourselves to realize the fullness of our own humanity.</p>
<p class="para">In <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, Melville includes many different forms of cannibal talk. Some of it is jocular, some almost cozy, some indifferent, some horrific, and some a tense mixture of several of these. In chapter 6, “The Street,” Melville tells us, “New Bedford beats all Water street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh” (36). The horror of the idea of “actual cannibals,” of people so inhuman that they commit the unspeakable act of eating other people, is offset by the comfortable, homey image of “chatting at street corners.” The passage also resonates with biblical cadence in the wonderful phrase “many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.” Melville has always been praised for his ear for language, and this small example shows both it and his use of cannibal talk.</p>
<p class="para">Ishmael takes an inordinate amount of time to get to sea. One-fifth of the book passes before he is outward bound aboard the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>. Queequeg is a central figure in these early chapters. Once Ishmael overcomes his fear of Queequeg, he identifies him as a cannibal almost with indifference. The term “cannibal” becomes simply a referent. In chapter 13, “Wheelbarrow,” for instance, Ishmael tells us, “As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms” (64).</p>
<p class="para">Queequeg is perhaps the noblest character in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, and yet he is also the one who tells Ishmael of the stomachache he got from a banquet at which fifty slain enemies were served up and eaten in one day (95). Cannibal talk is innately extravagant. That extravagance is grounded in the nature of cannibalism itself. For one human being to eat another is so unthinkable and repulsive within most cultures that the talk about such actions must be extravagant. Cannibalism itself is larger than life; it is far beyond accepted modes of behavior. Melville sees the inherent humor, as well as the seriousness, of cannibalism. He incorporates exaggeration and the absurd level of horror that attaches to the subject in describing the scene of the devouring of the fifty corpses. The excess corpses are “placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys” (95). This description is both funny and revolting. The absurd level of horror associated with cannibal talk can be seen in Ishmael’s response to Queequeg’s discussion of the cannibal feast: “‘No more, Queequeg,’ said I, shuddering; ‘that will do;’ for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them ” (95).</p>
<a id="page698"/>
<p class="para">In contrast to Ishmael’s horror at Queequeg’s devouring of these enemy corpses is his image of the priest’s children, “little cannibal urchins,” who take the smallest of the whale skeleton’s vertebrae to play marbles in chapter 103, “Measurement of the Whale’s Skeleton. ” What could be a horrific vision—children raised to eat other humans, who then play with bones—becomes benign.</p>
<p class="para">When Melville moves from Ishmael and Queequeg to Stubb, and finally to Ahab, his vision of cannibalism darkens. Unlike most whalemen, Stubb enjoys eating whale meat. There is nothing inherently wrong with whale meat, but to eat it was culturally unacceptable—just as most nineteenth-century Americans did not eat tomatoes raw and just as we do not eat cats, dogs, or tarantulas, as other people in some other cultures do. Melville portrays Stubb’s devouring of whale meat as essentially cannibalistic. At the end of chapter 64, “Stubb’s Supper,” the old black cook, Fleece, emerges as the voice of dignity—the voice to which the reader must listen rather than to the voice of Stubb. When Fleece, thinking of Stubb, mutters, “Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if he ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself” (324), Melville metaphorically ties all three—Stubb, the sharks, and the whale—together and therefore makes the eating of each by the other a cannibalistic feast. This connection becomes explicit when Melville writes of sharks hanging about an embattled naval vessel, ready to devour every killed man, while the “butchers,” the naval surgeons, are “cannibally carving each other’s live meat” (319).</p>
<p class="para">The true horror of cannibal talk in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> rests not in Stubb, however, but in Ahab. Ahab calls himself “cannibal old me” (592). In his pursuit of the white whale, he eats himself alive. He keeps “pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare,” and then cries out in existential anguish: “Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm?” (592).</p>
<p class="para">In his use of cannibal talk, Melville moves from the literal to the metaphoric to the existential. We are left shaken, moved, uncertain, and forced to question all our certainties.</p>
