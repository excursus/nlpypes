<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">N</span></span>ot many years ago, at an elite northeastern university, a prominent English literary critic was asked which was the greatest English novel. The room was paneled and lit by a chandelier, the windows heavily draped, the bookshelves lined with leatherbound classics—furnishings all carefully assembled to replicate an Old World atmosphere. There was not a whiff of sea air in that room. With the combination of eagerness and resentment that sometimes greets the proclamation of a standard, the students leaned forward to hear from their eminent guest. “<span class="italic">Middlemarch</span> would be my candidate,” he said tentatively, “unless by English novel you mean novel <span class="italic">in English</span>, in which case it would, of course, be <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">That <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, this sea monster of a book, could be declared self-evidently the greatest work of fiction in the language by an arbiter of literary taste would have amazed Herman Melville—not because he did not believe it to be true, but because he doubted the palatability of his truth. Melville was an artist of the highest ambition, but he thought of himself as a writer whose insolence and candor would never become the currency of genteel common rooms. “A whaleship was my Yale College and my Harvard,” he wrote in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, which is a book full of wild and untamable characters—“mongrel renegades, and castaways,” Melville called them—and written in frank contempt for the genteel life:</p>
<a id="pagexx"/>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">The port would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality;…With all her might she crowds all sail off shore…seeks all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These lines about the fatality of coziness and comfort bear Melville’s unmistakable stylistic signature. No one in America had ever written prose of such compressed intensity (“the lashed sea’s landlessness”) and taunting contradictions (“for refuge’s sake forlornly rushing into peril”). As anyone encountering <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> for the first time will discover, it is a book that struggles to maintain its narrative drive against the impulse to digress and meditate and play. One reason for this is that Melville was indefatigably alert to what might be called the stages of a word’s career—as in his use of “pitiful,” a word that vibrates between its old meaning (full of pity) and the more modern meaning it was acquiring in Melville’s time: pathetic, exhausted, impotent. Melville does not employ words in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>; he savors them.</p>
<p class="para">A noisy book written in a braggart’s voice (“Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an inkstand!”), <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is also a book of exquisite refinement. With all its sprawl and bluster, it can suddenly subside into the mood of “mowers…sleeping among the new-mown hay” and evoke the “snow-white wings of small, unspeckled birds…the gentle thoughts of the feminine air.” Even its most dramatic chapters rarely end in crescendo but tend to resolve themselves into a reflective quiet that chastens like the sound of strings after brass.</p>
<p class="para">Despite its patent beauties, Melville’s novel was, like Whitman’s <span class="italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, a “language experiment” that struck many of its, first readers as overwrought and bewildering. “Not worth the money asked for it, either as a literary work or as a mass of printed paper” was the judgment of the <span class="italic">Boston Post</span>, and although other reviewers appreciated its “easy, rollicking freedom of language and structure,” <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> was regarded at best as a curiosity and at worst <a id="pagexxi"/>a botch. In some moods Melville claimed to be unhurt by the public rebuke; he was, he wrote to Hawthorne, “content to have our paper allegories ill comprehended.” But in other moods he was devastated that he had failed to touch the nerve of the American public. That Melville was disappointed is hardly surprising, but that he was bitterly shocked is a sign of what was at stake. He wrote <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> in a messianic fervor because he wanted to save his country from itself.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">One way to approach Melville’s forbidding text is to regard it as part of his lifelong meditation on America. The country into which Melville was born in 1819 was a nation where the vestiges of aristocracy were fading, and where anyone who defended the idea of inherited privilege ran the risk of being charged with treason. National politics, the conduct of which had once been handed back and forth between New England blue bloods and Virginia gentry, was becoming the scene of feisty combat among populist heroes like Andrew Jackson and political professionals like Martin Van Buren. But even as the disfranchised Melville chafed in this vulgar country, he relished its impatience with pretension and the liberation it promised from the burdens of the past. In <span class="italic">Pierre: or the Ambiguities</span>, the novel he wrote just after <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, he remarked that</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">in countries like America, where there is no distinct hereditary caste of gentlemen, whose order is factitiously perpetuated as race-horses and lords are in kingly lands; and especially, in those agricultural districts, where, of a hundred hands that drop a ballot for the Presidency, ninety-nine shall be of the brownest and the brawniest; in such districts, this daintiness of the fingers, when united with a generally manly aspect, assumes a remarkableness unknown in European nations.</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Melville’s early years were spent in an effort to come to terms with his own “remarkableness.” It was a strenuous effort, in which the young man struggled against an insurgent biliousness that he disliked in himself. Both his grandfathers had been heroes of the <a id="pagexxii"/>Revolutionary War, and when his less distinguished father died—a failure in the haberdashery business—the young Melville was compelled to fight his own resentment at being overtaken by men of lesser heritage. Among the novels that preceded <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, several were records of this struggle: <span class="italic">Redburn</span> (1849), in which a young man journeys down the Hudson from his once-glorious family seat and endures the embarrassment of being unable to pay his passage; <span class="italic">White Jacket</span> (1850), in which another gentle youth enters a mariners’ world, where the, only measure of status is competence in the rigging. These books were retrospective meditations on Melville’s years of wandering—first aboard a merchant vessel that took him to Europe, later as a crewman on a United States frigate in the Pacific.</p>
<p class="para">Through these books Melville began to enlarge his private trials into an allegory of the nation’s. In Liverpool, trying in vain to navigate the city with the help of his father’s outdated guidebook, Redburn comes face to face with the dark underside of England’s industrial power. When he encounters the shriveled form of a starving woman, chilled to blueness, and hears her whimper a faint cry from the gutter, he suspects a portent for Americans who were still claiming exemption from such horrors even while moving to challenge Britain for world primacy. In <span class="italic">White Jacket</span> Melville went on to explore, through the allegorical dilemma of a seaman about to be flogged for an infraction he did not commit, what it means to be stripped like a slave of all legal recourse and to feel in one’s hatred of the imperial master the very assertion of self that the law forbids. Preparing to rush headlong against the captain and hurl him into the sea, White Jacket reflects that</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">Nature has not implanted any power in man that was not meant to be exercised at times, though too often our powers have been abused. The privilege, inborn and inalienable, that every man has, of dying himself, and inflicting death upon another, was not given to us without a purpose. These are the last resources of an insulted and unendurable existence.</p>
</div>
<p class="para">It was in <span class="italic">Redburn</span> and <span class="italic">White Jacket</span> that Melville began to confront the gathering crisis of his time—the inevitable collision between <a id="pagexxiii"/>industrial and slave culture in the United States—but the books through which he had discovered himself as a writer were his earlier South Sea adventures, <span class="italic">Typee</span> (1846) and <span class="italic">Omoo</span> (1847). Quasi-autobiographical works that recounted (with embellishment) his brief stay in the Marquesan islands and his beachcombing days in Tahiti, these books were full of shameless olive-skinned women and intimately attentive native boys. Received as factual accounts of tribal life in the tropical world, they established (to his lasting regret) Melville’s reputation as “the man who lived among cannibals.” In fact, they were sophisticated explorations of the experience of cultural dislocation, written by a prodigious storyteller who negotiated carefully between his audience’s prurience and its prudery. Yet as late as the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of American Literature</span> of 1917, Melville was accorded merely an appreciative paragraph in the chapter on “Travellers and Explorers”—and without <span class="italic">Typee</span> and <span class="italic">Omoo</span> there may have been no mention at all.</p>
<p class="para">When Melville began work on <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, he was, in other words, a young writer (only thirty-one) who had already experienced the flush of literary celebrity and the fickleness of an audience that rejected him when he turned earnest in his huge metaphysical novel of 1849, <span class="italic">Mardi</span>. He referred to <span class="italic">Redburn</span> and <span class="italic">White Jacket</span> as “two jobs, which I have done for money—being forced to it, as other men are to sawing wood,” and although in 1847, with his sailor days behind him, he had married the daughter of a distinguished jurist, he never fully escaped from enervating economic pressure. By 1850 he was settled in substantial domesticity in a Berkshire farmhouse, but “the calm, the coolness,” he wrote to Hawthorne, “the silent grass-growing mood in which a man <span class="italic">ought</span> always to compose,—that, I fear, can seldom be mine. Dollars damn me; and the malicious Devil is forever grinning in upon me, holding the door ajar.” Melville was wrong about missing the fertility of tranquillity. In the harried months between the early spring of 1850 and the fall of 1851, he produced the greatest work of imagination in the history of our literature.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> opens conventionally enough. Writing in his old marketable mode, Melville begins with the intention to accommodate his estranged readership. But he soon swerves, away from the ad<a id="pagexxiv"/>ventures of a young man in flight from his own despondency, and he finds himself swept up by a larger tale—about a maimed sea captain and the prodigious white whale that has “dismasted” him. Although scholars still disagree over the evolution of the manuscript, there is general agreement that it went through several radically different versions. Melville’s friend, the influential critic Evert Duyckinck, read and approved an early draft but denigrated the final text as an “intellectual chowder” and there is other evidence that <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> lurched forward in spasms rather than being built systematically according to some initial plan. Yet despite efforts to match allusions to contemporary events, and otherwise to trace the process of revision, it remains impossible to see exactly how <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> grew from an adventure yarn into the giant work it became. Some of the incendiary events for Melville’s imagination are recoverable—especially his passionate friendship with Hawthorne, whose work and person inspired him beginning in the summer of 1850; and his renewed exposure to Shakespeare, whose blank-verse grandeur stirred him to emulation. But like the painting that Ishmael peers at in the Spouter Inn, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> will always remain “a boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted,” at least if one is intent on making out its compositional history.</p>
<p class="para">It is clear enough that as he rushed along, Melville had no particular concern to tidy up his book by sweeping it clean of the traces of its superseded stages. Three chapters into the story, for instance, we meet a figure named Bulkington, “six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam,” who seems a likely candidate to play a major part in the ensuing drama because of his ability to command from his crewmates a reverence that is neither worship nor fear. But Bulkington recedes from view until twenty chapters later: after Ishmael has befriended Queequeg and found his way to the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> and Ahab’s service, Melville buries him in a “six-inch chapter [that] is [his] stoneless grave.” Yet it is an open grave. Melville does not conceal Bulkington; he memorializes him, leaving him visible as a hinted alternative to Ahab. He is not revised out of the manuscript but remains as a tremor in the text—an idea of democratic leadership, whose ripples continue to move within the range of our awareness but who finds no <a id="pagexxv"/>fulfilled place within the world that Melville imagines into being.</p>
<p class="para">More than a crafted fiction, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is an outburst of a fluid consciousness in which ideas and persons appear and collide and form new combinations and sometimes drop away. If it begins as a young man’s adventures, by the thirtieth chapter Ishmael has all but vanished, and the narrative voice is no longer subject to laws governing conventional narration. Ishmael describes Ahab, for instance, dining with his officers in his quarters, and later in his cabin “by the stern windows;…sitting alone.” A little later Starbuck, humiliated in his efforts to hold Ahab to the ship’s commercial purpose, delivers a soliloquy by the mainmast where no one can overhear him—and yet Ishmael reports it all with the certainty of a confidant. After these inexplicable witnessings, the narrative, as if breaking under the weight of its improbabilities, gives way to stretches of song from the scattered crew.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is simply too large a book to be contained within one consistent consciousness subject to the laws of identity and physical plausibility. The narrating mind (called Ishmael at first) hurtles outward, gorging itself with whale lore and with the private memories of men who barely speak. Sometimes this narrative voice breaks out into choral effusion or splinters into the competitive chatter of the sailors. Yet the compositional principle of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is more than whim; it is as if Melville creates Ishmael in the image of his earlier versions of himself and then invites us to share the excitement of his self-destruction.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is in this sense a lethal book. Hostile to all conventions, it reveals the suffocating airlessness of Ishmael’s initial consciousness, which comes to know itself as little more than an anthology of received opinions. Staring at the “boggy, soggy” picture, Ishmael concludes that “the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons.” He is at first a prig and a prude, offended by Queequeg’s habit of washing his chest and leaving his face unscrubbed, not to mention the savage’s genuflections before his little wooden idol, Yojo, which strikes Ishmael as “the color of a three days’ old Congo baby.” But Ishmael’s saving charm is his capacity for humor at his own expense. He grows amused by his own absurdities, and by the time he sails aboard the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> in the <a id="pagexxvi"/>protective company of his now-beloved Queequeg, he has eliminated almost all his inherited conceptions—religious, social, political, even linguistic—from the categories of the sacred and the prudent and has moved them into the category of the arbitrary. Everything becomes unmoored, vulnerable, dispensable.</p>
<p class="para">This process of divestiture is represented in an extraordinary chapter titled “The Counterpane,” in which Melville reviews what in effect was the construction of Ishmael’s self. In the bed they share in the Spouter Inn, Queequeg’s tatooed arm lies across the quilted counterpane that covers Ishmael’s chest, and in the first waking moments, when the line between consciousness and unconsciousness remains indeterminate, Ishmael feels himself dissolve into the flesh and fabric that are touching him. He cannot distinguish between Queequeg’s arm and the quilt, or even between his own body and the coverings that press upon it. Through this liberating confusion he relives a childhood experience (whether dream or reality he cannot say) in which he had waked from an enforced sleep that had been his punishment for trying to climb up the chimney. Dimly making out in the darkness his hand hanging off the bed, he had not known it as his own; it seemed an alien object clasped in the hand of some threatening phantom, and he had not dared try to move it to see if it were free to be withdrawn. He feared breaking the uncertainty as much as submitting to it, and under the spell of fright and fascination, he transformed his stepmother’s anger into guilt. This was the moment, he seems now to realize, in which he discovered the proscribed otherness of his body and of the world it craved.</p>
<p class="para">Having relived this discovery, it is through the uninvited intimacy with Queequeg that Ishmael begins to unlearn his guilt. The reversal goes quickly, and he becomes both terrified and exhilarated by his new freedom. In a sexually redolent phrase, Melville has him remark “how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them,” and from that moment on, Ishmael achieves a certain distance from the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>’s hell-bent quest. The central theme of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> begins to emerge in this implicit contrast between the transfigured Ishmael, whose consciousness has been diffused into a promiscuous taste for all experience, and the wracked captain of “fiery eyes” who refuses all distraction from his crusade. <a id="pagexxvii"/>As the book moves on, Ishmael can hardly be located, while Ahab stands immovable, his pegleg anchored in his “stand-point”—the auger hole bored into the deck to keep him steady in a gale. “There was…a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of [Ahab’s] glance,” while Ishmael’s eyes are dreamy and roving. He frees himself from fear and anger and the appetite for retribution that they foster (“No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world”), while Ahab cannot be deterred from conquest and possession and revenge—not by Pip or Starbuck or even by the pleas of the captain of the <span class="italic">Rachel</span>, who begs for help in searching for his son lost at sea.</p>
<p class="para">It is through the encounter between these two principles—the widening embrace of Ishmael and the “monomania” of Ahab—that <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> takes form. Yet the book never becomes merely a contest between them, because Melville himself incorporates both, and he feels their claims with equal fervor. The expansion and unstiffening of Ishmael’s mind are more and more manifest in Melville’s own ecstatic wordplay, in his generic mischievousness and irreverent associations: the peeled pelt of the whale’s penis (“grandissimus,” the sailors call it) is worn as a “surplice” by the crewman who minces the blubber; and the King of England, Melville reports with glee, unknowingly pomades his hair with sperm-whale oil “in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state.” Yet despite his love of such imaginative frolic, Melville is also enchanted by his inhuman and entirely humorless captain. As Milton does for Satan, he gives many of the best lines to grim Ahab, whose contempt for the trivial greed of the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>’s owners is immensely attractive, and whose rage, however fatal, is simply magnificent:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!…Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black <a id="pagexxviii"/>blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Ahab speaks with what Melville elsewhere calls a “Niagara” roar and is dignified even when he is at his most appalling. He is on a mission, Ishmael is on a cruise—and <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is the record of their irresolvable confrontation.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Though this conflict played itself out independently within Melville’s mind, it also had specific corollaries in the actual scene of American politics. In one of its dimensions, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> was a prophecy that the American experiment of separate political entities “federated along one keel” was imperiled, that the ship of state (a common metaphor in contemporary oratory) was foundering. When Melville began to work in earnest on <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> in early 1850, the Congressional debates over the provisions of what became known as the Compromise of 1850 were reverberating in all the papers and parlors of the land. In early March a dying John Calhoun sat in silence in the Senate chamber as his speech was read by a fellow Senator—a speech full of foreboding and predictions of catastrophe unless the antislavery agitation ceased. Daniel Webster’s reply (“I speak today not as a Massachusetts man, nor as a Northern man, but as an American”), in which he defended the compromise—including the provisions demanding manumission of fugitive slaves—cost him the respect of many Northern intellectuals but saved the situation, at least for a time. Yet the real news out of Washington was that the fissure in the country was becoming unbridgeable, and that the last efforts of the great survivors from the early republic—Clay, Calhoun, and Webster—would ultimately prove unavailing. The nation would go on intact for a few more years, until the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the Dred Scott decision set the stage for civil war; but to astute observers it was already clear in 1850 that the dispute could be brokered no more.</p>
<p class="para">Among them was Melville. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> can be seen as a sustained meditation on the sectional crisis, and as such some readers have tried to assign specific political correspondences to its cast of characters: Ahab as the unrelenting Calhoun; Starbuck as New England <a id="pagexxix"/>prudence; Stubb as the eager Westerner; Flask, whom the “noble negro” Daggoo carries “on his broad back…[like] a snow-flake,” as exemplar of the slave South; even Moby Dick itself as the principle of whiteness in whose very pursuit the nation insured its doom.</p>
<p class="para">Imputing such allegorical fixities to Melville’s text is a tempting way to distribute and gain control over its inventory of unruly characters, and Melville was certainly alert to national politics. His brother Gansevoort had been active in the Democratic party, and he himself had indulged in long stretches of thinly disguised political commentary in <span class="italic">Mardi</span>. But <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is not a medieval morality play with a decipherable iconography. It is a disorderly elegy to democracy, which Melville saw as threatened on many sides: by the spirit of utilitarianism (represented comically by Bildad and Peleg), by the accelerating pace of expansionism (the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> is named after an Indian tribe obliterated in a seventeenth-century war with the Puritans), and by the drive toward industrial power (in the great “Try-Works” chapter the ship becomes a floating factory), which degrades men into mere instruments of a technological process. “To accomplish his object,” we are told, “Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order.” And yet with all his revulsion for the surging commercialism and land hunger of his time, Melville was equally suspicious of the motives and efficacy of reformers who whined from the sidelines. “With what quill,” he asks with Emersonian disdain, “did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formerly indite his circulars?”</p>
<p class="para">Melville, in short, extracted a human sample from a culture he both loved and abhorred, and he made of the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> a kind of Noah’s ark. Its crew and officers are representatives of a nation for which the “native [white] American…provides the brains, the rest of the world [“tiger-yellow” Fedallah and “gigantic, coal-black” Daggoo] as generously supplying the muscles.” Yet it is not exactly coercion that keeps the brawn in thrall; there is no sullenness in the crew’s obedience to Ahab once it is pledged. Stubb, for instance, is a kind of petty version of Ahab; he has the scurrying frenzy of a rodent but also an “invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness” that Ahab recognizes as a complement to his own <a id="pagexxx"/>immunity to prudence. And not just the officers but the men feel an ungrudging solidarity with their captain—a solidarity that Ahab seals with the soaring oratory to which he rises when Starbuck challenges him in “The Quarterdeck”:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">Hark ye yet again,—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond. But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me.</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent">These metaphysics are pitched at the first mate (who requires a “little lower layer” to break his resistance), but they are plain enough to the unlettered crew. Even as he manipulates them, Ahab knows their humanity; he knows that no man among them lives unaggrieved (even gentle Queequeg is a dispossessed king) and that all have a reservoir of pain that can be tapped by a leader who elevates common resentment to the uncommon level of heroic virtue. Like Ahab, every man feels maimed and hopes to find relief by assigning blame:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them…. All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick.</p>
</div>
<a id="pagexxxi"/>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Arguably the most brilliant demonstration in modern literature of the power of demagoguery, “The Quarterdeck” is not so much a prophecy of immediately succeeding events in the United States as it is a preview of the mass politics of our own century. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is also a study in leadership whose first hopeful hypothesis is Bulkington, but one in which Ahab prevails.</p>
<p class="para">Ahab’s political genius expresses itself with what Melville sometimes regards as an unrepeatable indecency: “what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land.” Like all such rhetorical gestures, this diffidence is calculated to excite desire. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> pulls the reader into Ahab’s magnetic range even as it warns us away; to read <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is to be enchanted into the kind of self-forgetfulness from which Ishmael wakes after losing himself in the fused consciousness of the crew:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud seemed mine.</p>
</div>
<p class="para">It should be said that there is nothing irreducibly American about this wildness, just as there is nothing local or even finally national about the scope of Melville’s political imagination. In fact, as the Trinidadian writer C. L. R. James suggested long ago, Melville’s political vision of the mirrored fanaticism of ruler and ruled was to be most fully realized in Europe and only fitfully approached in the United States. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is a book of universal reach about the neediness of men when they are denied the props of rank and custom; a book about what can happen to men in conditions of radical exposure. It reports their jauntiness in the murderous business of killing whales, and it is hardly blind to their profligacy and cruelty—but it also honors their courage. It is a time-bound book of distinctively American accent, mainly in the sense that Melville realized, with his great contemporaries Emerson <a id="pagexxxii"/>and Whitman and Hawthorne and Thoreau, that the very idea of America entailed an obliteration of the past that placed unprecedented demands on the resources of the self.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">This newness was the theme of the literary explosion between 1835 and 1855 that has come to be known as the American renaissance: the movement on behalf of which Thoreau crowed “like chanticleer in the morning” at the discovery of his radical independence; in which Whitman exulted at the dissolution of all boundaries—temporal, sexual, linguistic; and whose chief spokesman, Emerson, chided his countrymen for being slow to break the linked conventions that they confused with the self. “The…terror,” Emerson remarked in “Self-Reliance” (1840), “that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loth to disappoint them.”</p>
<p class="para">The writers of the American renaissance were not, however, unanimous on this matter of scuttling the constructed self. Hawthorne, whose temperament was fundamentally conservative, reacted to his peers by becoming obsessed with the ways in which history survives as a constraining force in such an unhistorical country. And more than any of these considerable writers, Melville gave voice to both exhilaration and foreboding at the potentialities of the self unmoored:</p>

<p class="extractTextNoIndent">But this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent">Not even in Whitman is there a more ecstatic paean to democracy. But Melville also discloses in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> a slackened mood that Whitman concealed—as, for instance, in the great chapter on “The Whiteness of the Whale,” in which he wonders aloud whether the <a id="pagexxxiii"/>very notion of “centre and circumference” is anything more than a fond delusion:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color, and at the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?</p>

<p class="para">As this astonishing passage makes manifest, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is an angry book softened by a compassion that Melville practiced on himself. He could not muster Ahab’s cavalierness at the possibility that “there’s naught beyond” the pasteboard mask. Unable to confront this possibility with equanimity, he faced it down in <span class="italic">Moby-<a id="pagexxxiv"/>Dick</span> by dramatizing it as Ahab’s suspicion and by watching its effects on a psyche not quite his own. By the time of his next novel, <span class="italic">Pierre</span> (1852), which he began without pause after <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> and completed in the disconsolate aftermath of its reception, Ahab’s suspicion assaults Melville himself as a certainty:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">By vast pains we mine into the pyramid; by horrible gropings we come to the central room; with joy we espy the sarcophagus; but we lift the lid—and no body is there!—appallingly vacant as vast is the soul of a man!</p>
</div>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Pierre</span> is the novel in which Melville tests for himself the limits of tolerable knowledge, and it may therefore be a nervier book than <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, in which Melville still preserves a certain clinical detachment from the insupportable pain he is writing about. In <span class="italic">Pierre</span>, Melville confronts head-on the possibility that the idea of transcendence—the idea of a stable truth that exists outside of time and manifests legible meaning in the constitution of the universe—is not only undemonstrable but fatal to one’s ability to live in a contingent world. <span class="italic">Pierre</span> is Melville’s private howl at this recognition, and most readers have found the urgency of its prose not only incessant but frantic. In <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> Melville still manages to keep Ishmael’s intellectual play with the idea of a contingent universe apart from Ahab’s visceral rage. The result is the contrapuntal structure of the book—an aesthetic and, I think, a self-therapeutic triumph that Melville was never to achieve again.</p>
<p class="para">In <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> it is “Ahab and anguish [who] lay stretched together in one hammock,” and it is Ahab whose “torn body and gashed soul bled into one another.” To the extent that Ahab is freakish, his pain remains a pathology about which we may speculate rather than an articulate anguish that we recognize as a constituent part of our own experience. Melville also lets us overhear, through the great soliloquies, Ahab quarreling with himself. Ahab sees only fragments of a human world when he looks to sea; yet even as he enumerates the inventory of loss beneath the waves, “where unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot,” he knows his own embittered blindness to the “God<a id="pagexxxv"/>omnipresent…unwarped primal world” which the ocean comprehends. He longs for this world, but it is invisible to him.</p>
<p class="para">Filled as it is with uncommon characters and arcane nautical terms, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> never lets the alien world of whaling slip away into the merely exotic. Before <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is through with us, Ahab’s hourly calculations of the white whale’s course make perfect sense. Lest our imagination relax into the voyeurism that exotic stories permit, Melville turns homely illustrations into startling images by injecting them into strangely hospitable contexts: after staving the boats of Stubb and Flask, the whale “disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.” After reading this passage, can one ever move a spoon in a tureen without thinking back to it again?</p>
<p class="para">Deploying these kinds of images that collapse huge distances between worlds apart, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> reveals itself as an instance of sheer literary virtuosity. It furnishes one dazzling solution after another to the persistent literary problem of conveying to an innocent reader the palpable reality of an unfamiliar world, thereby making us feel at least potentially Ahab’s anguish as our own. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is not finally a statement or a puzzle or a performance—or any of the things that literary criticism would reduce it to. It is a book that begins by refusing to begin, deferring its own story by requiring the reader to force a passage through the “extracts,” which are the debris of other stories. It is a book that undercuts all its own conclusions—tutoring us in the anatomy and history of whales that are “wonderful…except after explanation”—so that it cannot properly be said to end. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is as nearly endless as an artifact can be. It was, and is, a gift to democracy because it compels our respect for “Men…[of] mean and meagre faces,” as well as for “man, in the ideal, [who] is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.”</p>
<p class="para">To read <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> is to acquire anew this knowledge, which, despite its indispensability for a democratic culture, can be dissipated by experience. Like the whale, it “must,” if we wish truly to read it, “remain unpainted to the last.” For anyone who has experienced <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, it is a privilege to introduce it to another <a id="pagexxxvi"/>reader—but a privilege that is abused if extended much beyond the invitation. As Melville says of the sperm whale’s brow, “I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can.”</p>
