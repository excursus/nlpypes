<p class="chapterOpenerText">Three nineteenth-century lexicons of nautical terms are particularly useful to those interested in usage of sea terminology roughly contemporaneous with the world of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick:</span> Richard Henry Dana’s <span class="italic">The Seaman’s Friend</span> (1857), W. Clark Russell’s <span class="italic">Sailors’ Language: A Collection of Sea-Terms and Their Definitions</span> (1883), and W. H. Smyth’s <span class="italic">The Sailor’s Word Book</span> (1867). Both Jill Gidmark in her <span class="italic">Melville Sea Dictionary</span> and Harrison Hayford and Hershel Parker in the Glossary of the Norton edition of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> make use of these works. <span class="italic">The Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of North America</span> (1874), by Charles Scammon, includes a glossary of terms particularly associated with whaling. The brief glossary that follows is a distillation of the definitions found in those works named above in combination with the more conventional and accessible definitions to be found in <span class="italic">The American Heritage Dictionary</span> (1969).</p>
<p class="para">Melville is often highly metaphoric in his use of nautical terminology, as when he writes “Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet” (a <span class="italic">hawser</span> is a large rope used for towing). On the other hand, there are instances where context not only does not supply a clue to what the word might mean but may actually be misleading, as when Stubb resumes “his supper at the capstan.” Melville, as in most things, is distinctive in his use of sea terms. In order to better see how nautical terminology plays out with amazing variety in the text, I have quoted a specimen passage from the novel after each definition. I have not defined terms relating to the several parts of a ship because the illustrations give a sufficient idea of the location and probable function of them, nor have I included those terms, such as <span class="italic">gam</span>, which Melville defines himself.</p>
