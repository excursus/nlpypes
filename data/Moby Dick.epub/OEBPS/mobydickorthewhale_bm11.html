<div class="chapterBody">
<p class="chapterOpenerText">Herman Melville spent almost four years at sea and served aboard a merchant vessel, three whaleships, and a naval frigate. His time at sea greatly influenced all his early works, particularly <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> (1851).</p>
<p class="para">Although he was born into an upper-middle-class family, Melville’s life changed at the age of ten when his father went bankrupt, then died two years later. Melville’s mother was left with eight children and no marketable skills. With their family in financial straits, the older children were forced to earn money. Melville shipped as a common sailor—not an officer—when he first went to sea at the age of nineteen. He signed on to the full-rigged merchant vessel <span class="italic">St. Lawrence</span>, under Oliver P. Brown, master, for a voyage from New York to Liverpool and back to New York. The passage to England took twenty-seven days, and the return home forty-nine days. Melville’s fourth book, <span class="italic">Redburn: His First Voyage</span> (1849), subtitled <span class="italic">Being the Sailor-boy Confessions and Reminiscences of the Son-of-a-Gentleman, in the Merchant Service</span>, describes in a fictional manner what Melville encountered as he learned the skills of a sailor.</p>
<p class="para">Melville’s next major trip was in 1840, when he traveled to Illinois by boat with his friend, Eli James Murdock Fly. Their three-day journey by canal boat from Albany to Buffalo, New York, may have provided the description of the Erie Canal found in “The Town-Ho’s Story,” chapter 54 of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>. Melville and Fly crossed Lake Erie by steamboat then booked passage from Detroit to Chicago on a Lake Huron and Lake Michigan steamboat. From Chicago, Melville and Fly crossed the prairie to Galena, Illinois. It is unknown whether Melville actually went up the Mississippi River, but his time on inland waterways decidedly influenced his tenth book, <span class="italic">The Confidence-Man</span>(1857), a bleak work of despair set on board the <span class="italic">Fidéle</span>, a Mississippi River steamboat.</p>
<p class="para">When Melville returned home, his family was still in financial trouble. He left for sea again, embarking from New Bedford, Massachusetts, on January 3, 1841, for the most influential voyage of his life. He joined the whaleship <span class="italic">Acushnet</span>, under Valentine Pease Jr., master, on its maiden voyage. His time on the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> is the basis for his account of a whaling voyage in his sixth book, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>. But the vessel Melville creates in <span class="italic">Moby- Dick</span>, the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>, is a fantastical Nantucket ship, with belaying pins of sperm whale teeth and a tiller made from the lower jaw of a sperm whale. At age twenty-one, Melville shipped as a green hand on the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span>—the same rank he had held on the <span class="italic">St. Lawrence</span>. However, before his whaling years were finished, Melville had worked his way <a id="page690"/>up to bow oarsman, the position held by Ishmael in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, and then possibly to boatsteerer, the whaleman’s term for a harpooneer.</p>
<p class="para">In November 1841, the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> spent six days at anchor off Chatham Island in the Galápagos. The islands were called enchanted because of the baffling currents in their surrounding waters, and it was in this strange and unworldly setting that Melville placed the ten sketches he titled “The Encantadas” (1854). The <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> returned to the Galápagos for the month of January 1842, but the six days at Chatham Island in 1841 were the longest continuous period during which Melville may have had the possibility of going ashore.</p>
<p class="para">The <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> arrived at Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands in July 1842, at the same moment that the French arrived to take command of the islands and change them forever. The Marquesas, along with the rest of French Polynesia, are still under French control almost 170 years later. French warships were anchored in Taioha’e Bay close to the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span>. It was at Taioha’e Bay that Melville and his shipmate Richard Tobias Greene deserted. Melville spent one month on the island (July 9 through August 9, 1842), but what he did during that month is still unknown. He and Greene were separated at some point, and Greene made his way back to the United States on the Fairhaven whaleship <span class="italic">London Packet</span>, only to be reunited with Melville in upstate New York four years later, in July 1846. Melville tells a story of adventure set on the island of Nuku Hiva in his first book, <span class="italic">Typee</span> (1846), but how much or how little is based on Melville’s own experiences is still under much debate by scholars.</p>
<p class="para">Melville left the Marquesas aboard the Australian whaleship <span class="italic">Lucy Ann</span>, with Henry Ventom as master. Now signed on as an able seaman, he joined a crew torn by dissent. The <span class="italic">Lucy Ann</span> was barque rigged and quite small, only eighty-seven feet long, with a sickly captain and a first mate, James German, who was prone to drink. Additionally, the vessel was inadequately officered. It carried four whaleboats but had only one mate, two illiterate boatsteerers, and a newly shipped boatsteerer who soon turned against the captain. A whaleship carrying four whaleboats would normally carry four mates and four boatsteerers. The captain soon became very ill, and German headed for Tahiti, where the captain was put ashore. In an effort to prevent desertion while yet staying close to the captain, the <span class="italic">Lucy Ann</span> left port and sailed back and forth off the harbor of Papeete, Tahiti; there, ten men refused duty. These ten men were held on the French frigate <span class="italic">la Reine Blanche</span>; later, they were taken to a Tahitian calaboose (jail). Melville joined the mutineers in their confinement ashore. Roughly three weeks later, in October 1842, Melville escaped to the neighboring island of Eimeo (now Mooréa), Society Islands. Melville’s passage on the <span class="italic">Lucy Ann</span>, the mutiny, and his imprisonment are treated in his second book, <span class="italic">Omoo</span> (1847).</p>
<a id="page691"/>
<p class="para">Melville wandered the island of Eimeo until November 1842, when he joined the Nantucket whaleship <span class="italic">Charles and Henry</span>, with John B. Coleman Jr. as master. Melville evidently signed on as a boatsteerer and spent five months aboard the <span class="italic">Charles and Henry</span>, much less than the claim of “the author’s own personal experience, of two years &amp; more, as a harpooneer” that he made to his English publisher, Richard Bentley (Letter of 27 June 1850). From his time on the <span class="italic">Charles and Henry</span>, Melville drew the beginning of his third book, <span class="italic">Mardi</span> (1849). Coleman was the best of the captains with whom Melville sailed, treating his men decently and giving them enough to eat. Scholars have connected Coleman’s decency with the positive portrayal of Nantucket whalemen in “Nantucket, ” chapter 14 of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, especially since Melville did not visit the island until after the book’s publication.</p>
<p class="para">Discharged at Lahaina, Maui, Melville traveled to Honolulu, Oahu, and prepared to settle for a while. But during his stay the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> came into port, and Valentine Pease Jr. filed an affidavit on June 2, 1843, taking notice of Melville’s desertion eleven months earlier, a federal offense. Homesick and with an affidavit filed against him, Melville enlisted as an ordinary seaman on the American naval frigate <span class="italic">United States</span>, under James Armstrong, and headed for New England. Melville was one of approximately 480 men aboard the frigate, which sailed under the pennant of Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones.</p>
<p class="para">During Melville’s fourteen months on the <span class="italic">United States</span>, he witnessed 163 floggings. His absolute hatred of this form of corporal punishment slashes through his fifth book, <span class="italic">White-Jacket</span> (1850) and also drives much of his final work, <span class="italic">Billy Budd, Sailor</span> (posthumously published in 1924). Melville’s long period at sea ended on October 3, 1844, when the <span class="italic">United States</span> arrived at Boston.</p>
<p class="para">When Melville first went to sea, he was thrust into a world entirely new to him. Sailors sleep differently, eat differently, interact differently, and, most obviously, speak differently than people on land. Melville writes of this difference and its effect in chapter 13 of <span class="italic">Redburn</span>:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">People who have never gone to sea for the first time as sailors, can not imagine how puzzling and confounding it is. It must be like going into a barbarous country, where they speak a strange dialect, and dress in strange clothes, and live in strange houses. For sailors have their own names, even for things that are familiar ashore; and if you call a thing by its shore name, you are laughed at for an ignoramus and a land-lubber.</p></div>
<a id="page692"/>
<p class="para">One’s understanding of the world is thrown off kilter, physically as well as emotionally and intellectually. The world of a ship is in constant motion, and sailors, especially before the twentieth century, never had enough sleep; they were always to some extent sleep deprived. Lack of sleep and the nausea of seasickness caused sailors to navigate their new world slowly and tenuously.</p>
<p class="para">Melville entered such a world when he shipped aboard the merchant vessel <span class="italic">St. Lawrence</span>. He had to learn the various forms of “sailor talk ”: technical terminology, occupational lore, coterie speech—the coded language that arises out of the shared experiences of particular crews—as well as folkloric forms of music, argument, and yarning and the discourse, or generalized language, that is used by and about seamen.</p>
<p class="para">Technical terminology is essential aboard ship. When given a command, a sailor must know exactly which of the hundreds of lines he is to pull. As Melville explains in chapter 13 of <span class="italic">Redburn</span>:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">[T]here is such an infinite number of totally new names of new things to learn, that at first it seemed impossible for me to master them all. If you have ever seen a ship, you must have remarked what a thicket of ropes there are; and how they all seemed mixed and entangled together like a great skein of yarn. Now the very smallest of these ropes has its own proper name, and many of them are very lengthy, like the names of young royal princes, such as the <span class="italic">starboard-main-top-gallant-bow-line</span>, or the <span class="italic">larboard-fore-top-sail-clue-line</span> [emphasis in original].</p>
</div>
<p class="para">Although the examples seem over the top, they are in fact the true names of lines found on board a square-rigged sailing ship. Melville, as always, throws in humor with his reference to the “names of young royal princes.” Unlike a prince’s name, however, all parts of the rope’s name are necessarily always used. Consider the example of the “ <span class="italic">larboard-fore-top-sail-clue-line</span>. ” Many sails have clewlines, so this particular line is distinguished by the fact that it is a <span class="italic">topsail</span> clewline. However, a full-rigged ship such as the <span class="italic">St. Lawrence</span> or the fictional <span class="italic">Highlander</span> has three topsails—one on each of the three masts—so this particular clewline is the clewline for the <span class="italic">fore</span> topsail. Even then, the fore topsail has two clewlines, so the line being referred to is the <span class="italic">larboard</span> (port) clewline. A full-rigged ship such as the <span class="italic">St. Lawrence</span> would have close to two hundred separate lines.</p>
<p class="para">When Melville set sail on the whaleship <span class="italic">Acushnet</span>, the technical terminology he had learned on the merchant vessel <span class="italic">St. Lawrence</span> was no longer adequate. The language of whaleships was different from that of merchant vessels, and the language of both different yet again from that of naval vessels.</p>
<a id="page693"/>
<p class="para">In chapter 4 of <span class="italic">White-Jacket</span>, Melville makes such differences explicit when he has Jack Chase, the ultimate naval sailor, invite Tubbs, a whaleman newly recruited into the navy, to the main-top. Flattered, Tubbs, who is “eternally talking of line-tubs, Nantucket, sperm oil, stove boats, and Japan,” quickly climbs aloft to join the other sailors and begins to laud his former occupation. Outraged, Jack Chase bursts out:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">Why, you limb of Nantucket! you train-oil man! you sea-tallow strainer! you bobber after carrion!…And what did you know, you bumpkin! before you came on board this <span class="italic">Andrew Miller</span>? What knew you of gun- deck, or orlop, mustering round the capstan, beating to quarters, and piping to dinner? Did you ever roll to <span class="italic">grog</span> on board your greasy ballyhoo of blazes? Did you ever winter at Mahon? Did you ever ‘<span class="italic">lash and carry</span>?’…Bah! You are full of the fore-peak and the forecastle; you are only familiar with Burtons and Billy-tackles; your ambition never mounted above pig-killing!…Begone! you graceless, godless knave! [emphasis in original].</p></div>
<p class="para">Jack Chase condemns Tubbs’s language—although interestingly he is able to use it correctly when he himself speaks of “train-oil,” “Burtons,” and “Billy-tackles”—and praises his own. Knowledge of the specificity of “orlop,” “mustering,” and “beating to quarters” are necessary for survival on a man-of-war, both within the ship and against one’s enemies.</p>
<p class="para">Melville had to learn the language of the whaleman aboard the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span>. “Thar she blows!” was the cry used upon spotting a whale, and “Townor!” was the cry when a second whale was spotted. But “townor ” was also used when a tortoise was found on the Galápagos Islands, especially when the tortoise was too big for one man to carry. The speech of the second mate Stubb to his whaleboat crew while they row in pursuit of a whale in chapter 48, “The First Lowering,” is a wonderful example of sailor talk specifically for whalemen:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little ones…Why don’t you break your backbones, my boys?…So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes!…The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don’t ye pull?—pull and break <a id="page694"/>something! pull, and start your eyes out!…that looks like it, my steel- bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-spikes! (237 38)</p>
</div>
<p class="para">Some of Stubb’s terms are common to all sailors, such as “ginger-cakes,” “steel- bits,” and “marling-spikes.” The ginger in ginger cakes helped prevent seasickness. Ginger cakes and “ginger-jub,” the fiery, nonalcoholic drink offered to Queequeg in chapter 72, were occasionally given to sailors for that reason—although both were still considered treats and so doled out sparingly. Steel bits are metal pieces set into the deck, to which lines are made fast. And marling-spikes, often spelled marlinespikes or marlinspikes, are sailors’ tools used for splicing and when working aloft in the rigging. But gudgeons are specific to pulling boats with rudders, such as whaleboats, and so would not be a term known by all sailors. And what, one wonders, would a non-whaleman make of the phrase “hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes”?</p>
<p class="para">Melville is unusual in that he served on three distinct types of vessels: merchant vessel, whaleship, and naval frigate. He mastered the language of all three, as seen in <span class="italic">Redburn</span>, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, and <span class="italic">White-Jacket</span>, respectively. Even more, however, his four-year immersion in sailor talk combined with his tremendous reading created in him a love of language that resulted in the astounding, transcendent, almost overpowering language of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>. That language is one of his greatest achievements.</p>
