<p class="chapterOpenerText">The Second Great Awakening, a popular ecumenical Christian religious revival beginning in the last decade of the eighteenth century and continuing through the 1840s, profoundly shaped the American culture in which Herman Melville came of age. This pervasive social movement generated a lively interest in a variety of social causes, ranging from temperance to the abolition of slavery. Both the religious and social facets of this movement relied on the power of charismatic speakers at public meetings to persuade and inspire passionate involvement and commitment in listeners. Cultural familiarity with the sermon—as well as its function, structure, and historic significance—imbued the speakers’ words with additional moral force.</p>
<p class="para">Sermons performed an essential role in the colonization of New England by the British. Following the establishment of the first printing press in the New World at Harvard College in 1639, countless sermons and tracts were published throughout the colonial and early American periods, helping to give early New England one of the highest literacy rates in the world. One popular and distinctive variant of these religious works were narratives of captivity among the Indians. These stories pondered the lessons imparted to Protestant Christians during their time as captives among both followers of traditional native spiritual practices and natives who had converted to Catholicism. The latter were perceived as equally different and perhaps more dangerous by the Puritan writers of such works.</p>
<p class="para">When Melville shipped out on the <span class="italic">Acushnet</span> and journeyed to the South Pacific, he entered for the first time a world in which the sermon functioned as a means of encounter with cultures vastly different from that of his upbringing. His first book, <span class="italic">Typee</span>(1846), purports to relate his own version of the captivity narrative based on his sojourn on the Marquesan island of Nuku Hiva. The book’s narrator recounts a tale of his accidental captivity among the Typee, a reputedly cannibal tribe, after his desertion from a whaleship. In this book, Melville first employs the sermon form for his own subversive purposes, using it to question the role of missionaries in the destruction of native culture.</p>
<p class="para">Sermons are created through the process of exegesis: the analysis of a scriptural text, aimed at clarifying and expounding on its meaning and deriving lessons from it relevant to the sermon’s audience. A typical sermon first paraphrases the original text, using familiar language to recount the narrative or injunction in the original in ways accessible to the listeners. It places the text within its original context, showing the broader circumstances or arguments that surround the particular text. Next, the sermon <a id="page700"/>will identify the broader spiritual, doctrinal, and moral questions the text addresses. Finally, the sermon will show the relevance of these questions to the current state of the audience and reveal the meaning of the text as it applies to the spiritual needs of the listeners.</p>
<p class="para">Sermons are intended to instruct and persuade. Melville took advantage of the ingrained response of his readership to the sermon form to employ it in ways that led them to question their own conventional beliefs and attitudes regarding religion, civilization versus savagery, and moral certainty. In <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> (1851), he presents the sermon form in both straightforward and devious ways. There are three overtly identified sermons in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>: Father Mapple’s sermon in chapter 9, “The Sermon ” Ishmael’s brief “sermon ” to Captains Bildad and Peleg on behalf of Queequeg in chapter 18, “His Mark ” and the cook Fleece’s sermon to the sharks at the behest of second mate Stubb in chapter 64, “Stubb’s Supper.”</p>
<p class="para">Father Mapple’s sermon develops in thoroughly conventional ways, using the standard patterns, but there is perhaps less to this sermon than meets the eye. Father Mapple’s dramatic entrance into the nautically decorated chapel gives Ishmael pause: he wonders if the preacher is simply acting the part, and the excuses Ishmael finds for Mapple’s theatricality fail to convince. Mapple’s retelling of the biblical story of Jonah in sailor vernacular is entertaining, but the “great lessons” he derives are simply: “Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah ” (52) and “preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood” (54)—hardly profound analysis. Ishmael pays lip service to conventional religion when he says “the pulpit is ever this earth’s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world ” (45), but he leaves the chapel and goes directly back to his lodging where he joins Queequeg in worshipping the pagan idol Yojo. Father Mapple’s shallow sermon has no persuasive effect on Ishmael, nor, by implication, on the reader.</p>
<p class="para">The other two sermons show Melville’s subversion of the form more plainly. Ishmael’s response to Captain Bildad’s query as to whether Queequeg is “at present in communion with any christian church?” (96) claims the cannibal Queequeg as a member of “the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world” (97). After signing on Queequeg, Bildad pursues his religious concerns with him but is brought up short by Captain Peleg: “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who ain’t pretty sharkish” (99). This equation of impiety, cannibals, and sharks resurfaces in the third sermon, wherein the cook Fleece, at second mate Stubb’s command, preaches to the sharks for Stubb’s entertainment while Stubb consumes a cannibal-like meal of whale meat as the sharks likewise devour the whale.</p>

<p class="para">There are, however, numerous other sermons in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, for Melville employs the form of the sermon frequently when he examines and analyzes elements of the whale fishery to discover deeper meanings in its mundane details. He engages the form and function of sermons in a variety of ways: in chapter 32, “Cetology,” he parodies the stereotypical long-winded, boring sermon, dragging the reader with malicious glee through endless details and pompous assertions regarding the natural history of the whale and ending with a plea for “Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!” (157). Generations of students have struggled through this chapter, not appreciating that Melville is in fact making fun of the dreary exegesis he mocks. Other chapters such as “The Mat-Maker ” (chapter 47), “Brit” (chapter 58), “The Line” (chapter 60), “The Tail” (chapter 86), and “A Squeeze of the Hand ” (chapter 94) employ the form of the sermon more seriously. “The Line ” serves as an excellent example: Melville takes for his text not a line of scripture but the whale line attached to the harpoon, and subjects it to a full exegesis that details its substance, context, and function and ends with a breathtaking insight into the precarious nature of the human condition.</p>
