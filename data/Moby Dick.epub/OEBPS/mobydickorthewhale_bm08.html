<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Morning Herald</span></span><span class="bold">, October 20, 1851:</span> Herman Melville is on the right track now. His “Omoo,” “Typee,” and “White-jacket,” gave evidence of great and peculiar powers; but the audacity of youthful genius impelled him to throw off these performances with “a too much vigour,” as Dryden has it, which sometimes goes near to defeat its own end. But in “The Whale,” his new work, just published, we see a concentration of the whole powers of <span class="italic">the man</span>. Resolutely discarding all that does not bear directly on the matter in hand, he has succeeded in painting such a picture—now lurid, now a blaze with splendour—of sea life, in its most arduous and exciting form, as for vigour, originality, and interest, has never been surpassed.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"> <span class="italic">Morning Advertiser</span></span><span class="bold">, October 24, 1851:</span> To convey an adequate idea of a book of such various merits as that which the author of “Typee” and “Omoo” has here placed before the reading public, is impossible in the scope of a review. High philosophy, liberal feeling, abstruse metaphysics popularly phrased, soaring speculation, a style as many-coloured as the theme, yet always good, and often admirable; fertile fancy, ingenious construction, playful learning, and an unusual power of enchaining the interest, and rising to the verge of the sublime, without overpassing that narrow boundary which plunges the ambitious penman into the ridiculous: all these are possessed by Herman Melville, and exemplified in these volumes.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Athenaeum</span></span><span class="bold">, October 25, 1851:</span> This is an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact. The idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition. The style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad (rather than bad) English; and its catastrophe is hastily, weakly, and obscurely managed. The second title—‘Moby Dick’—is the name given to a particular sperm whale, or white sea monster, more malignant and diabolical even than the sperm whale in general is known to be. This ocean fiend is invested with especial horrors for our ship’s crew;—because, once upon a time, a conflict with him cost their Captain a limb. Captain Ahab had an ivory leg made,—took an oath of retribution,—grew crazy,—lashed himself up into a purpose of cruising in quest of his adversary,—and bound all who sailed with him to stand by him in his wrath. With this <a id="page672"/>cheerful Captain, on such a wise and Christian voyage of discovery, went to sea Ishmael, the imaginary writer of this narrative.</p>
<p class="para">Frantic though such an invention seems to be, it might possibly have been accepted as the motive and purpose of an <span class="italic">extravaganza</span> had its author been consistent with himself. Nay, in such a terrible cause—when Krakens and Typhoons and the wonders of Mid-Ocean, &amp;c. &amp;c. were the topics and toys to be arranged and manoeuvred—we might have stretched a point in admission of electrical verbs and adjectives as hoarse as the hurricane. There is a time for everything in imaginative literature;—and, according to its order, a place—for rant as well as for reserve; but the rant must be good, honest, shameless rant, without flaw or misgiving. The voice of “the storm wind Euroclydon” must not be interrupted by the facts of Scoresby and the figures of Cocker. Ravings and scraps of useful knowledge flung together salad-wise make a dish in which there may be much surprise, but in which there is little savour. The real secret of this patchiness in the present case is disclosed in Mr. Melville’s appendix; which contains such an assortment of curious quotations as Southey might have wrought up into a whale-chapter for ‘The Doctor,’—suggesting the idea that a substantial work on the subject may have been originally contemplated. Either Mr. Melville’s purpose must have changed, or his power must have fallen short. The result is, at all events, a most provoking book,—neither so utterly extravagant as to be entirely comfortable nor so instructively complete as to take place among documents on the subject of the Great Fish, his capabilities, his home and his capture. Our author must be henceforth numbered in the company of the incorrigibles who occasionally tantalize us with indications of genius, while they constantly summon us to endure monstrosities, carelessnesses, and other such harassing manifestations of bad taste as daring or disordered ingenuity can devise.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">John Bull</span></span><span class="bold">, October 25, 1851:</span> Of all the extraordinary books from the pen of Herman Melville this is out and out the most extraordinary. Who would have looked for philosophy in whales, or for poetry in blubber. Yet few books which professedly deal in metaphysics, or claim the parentage of the muses, contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as the tale of the <span class="italic">Pequod’s</span> whaling expedition. Hardly has the ship set sail from Nantucket than it is, with its strangely assorted crew on board, isolated from the rest of creation; wholly engulphed, as it were, in the world of whales, a world peculiar to itself, and, as the reader of these volumes will find, as brimful of matters of deepest interest as any other sublunary world. In that wonderful world the most extravagant specimens of the genus <span class="italic">homo</span>, the offspring of Herman Melville’s wild and grotesque fancy, are pursuing their career of adventure and of danger <a id="page673"/>with an energy not unlike that of the whale himself; their chieftain, Captain Ahab, being a perfect match in every way for his foe-whale Moby Dick.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Spectator</span></span><span class="bold">, October 25, 1851:</span> This sea novel is a singular medley of naval observation, magazine article writing, satiric reflection upon the conventionalisms of civilized life, and rhapsody run mad. So far as the nautical parts are appropriate and unmixed, the portraiture is truthful and interesting. Some of the satire, especially in the early parts, is biting and reckless. The chapter-spinning is various in character; now powerful from the vigorous and fertile fancy of the author, now little more than empty though sounding phrases. The rhapsody belongs to wordmongering where ideas are the staple; where it takes the shape of narrative or dramatic fiction, it is phantasmal—an attempted description of what is impossible in nature and without probability in art; it repels the reader instead of attracting him….</p>
<p class="para">The “marvellous” injures the book by disjointing the narrative, as well as by its inherent want of interest, at least as managed by Mr. Melville. In the superstition of some whalers, (grounded upon the malicious foresight which occasionally characterizes the attacks of the sperm fish upon boats sent to capture it,) there is a <span class="italic">white</span> whale which possesses supernatural power. To capture or even to hurt it is beyond the art of man; the skill of the whaler is useless; the harpoon does not wound it; it exhibits a contemptuous strategy in its attacks upon the boats of its pursuers; and happy is the vessel where only loss of limb, or of a single life, attends its chase. Ahab, the master of the Pequod—a mariner of long experience, stern resolve, and indomitable courage, the high hero of romance, in short, transferred to a whale-ship—has lost his leg in a contest with the white whale. Instead of daunting Ahab, the loss exasperates him; and by long brooding over it his reason becomes shaken. In this condition he undertakes the voyage; making the chase of his fishy antagonist the sole object of his thoughts, and, so far as he can without exciting overt insubordination among his officers, the object of his proceedings.</p>
<p class="para">Such a groundwork is hardly natural enough for a regular-built novel, though it might form a tale, if properly managed. But Mr. Melville’s mysteries provoke wonder at the author rather than terror at the creation; the soliloquies and dialogues of Ahab, in which the author attempts delineating the wild imaginings of monomania, and exhibiting some profoundly speculative views of things in general, induce weariness or skipping; while the whole scheme mars, as we have said, the nautical continuity of story—greatly assisted by various chapters of the bookmaking kind.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"> <span class="italic">Britannia</span></span><span class="bold">, November 8, 1851:</span> <span class="italic">The Whale</span> is a most extraordinary work. There is so much eccentricity in its style and in its construction, in the original <a id="page674"/>conception and in the gradual development of its strange and improbable story, that we are at a loss to determine in what category of works of amusement to place it. It is certainly neither a novel nor a romance, although it is made to drag its weary length through three closely printed volumes, and is published by Bentley, who, <span class="italic">par excellence</span>, is the publisher of the novels of the fashionable world, for who ever heard of novel or romance without a heroine or a single love scene? The plot of the narrative is scarcely worthy of the name, as it hangs entirely on the inveterate pursuit by a monomaniac old Captain after a certain humpbacked whale, who in some previous voyage had bitten off one of his legs, and whose destruction he had bound himself and his crew by terrible oaths to accomplish, in revenge for the injury he had himself sustained. The tragical catastrophe, which innumerable signs, omens, and superstitious warnings are constantly predicting to the infatuated commander, is the wreck of the ship, and the loss of the whole crew in the frantic attack that is made upon the invincible white whale.</p>

<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Leader</span></span><span class="bold">, November 8, 1851:</span> Want of originality has long been the just and standing reproach to American literature; the best of its writers were but second-hand Englishmen. Of late some have given evidence of originality; not <span class="italic">absolute</span> originality, but such genuine outcoming of the American intellect as can be safely called national. Edgar Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville are assuredly no British offshoots; nor is Emerson—the <span class="italic">German</span> American that he is! The observer of this commencement of an American literature, properly so called, will notice as significant that these writers have a wild and mystic love of the supersensual, peculiarly their own. To move a horror skillfully, with something of the earnest faith in the Unseen, and with weird imagery to shape these Phantasms so vividly that the most incredulous mind is hushed, absorbed—to do this no European pen has apparently any longer the power—to do this American literature is without a rival. What <span class="italic">romance</span> writer can be named with Hawthorne? Who knows the terrors of the seas like Herman Melville?</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">The Whale</span>—Melville’s last book—is a strange, wild, weird book, full of poetry and full of interest. To use a hackneyed phrase, it is indeed “refreshing ” to quit the old, worn-out pathways of romance, and feel the sea breezes playing through our hair, the salt spray dashing on our brows, as we do here. One tires terribly of ballrooms, dinners, and the incidents of town life! One never tires of Nature. And there is Nature here, though the daring imagery often grows riotously extravagant.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the London</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Morning Post</span></span><span class="bold">, November 14, 1851:</span> There is much that is incredible and a little that is incomprehensible in this latest effort of Mr. Melville’s wayward and romantic pen; but despite its occasional extravagancies, it is a book of extraordinary <a id="page675"/>merit, and one which will do great things for the literary reputation of its author. “Take it fore and aft,” as the sailors say, it is a work of great power and beauty, and our remembrance cannot fellow it with any other modern work of a similar class, equally clever and equally entertaining. Judgment is occasionally shocked by the improbable character of the incidents narrated—and even reason is not always treated with that punctilious deference she has a right to expect—but imagination is banquetted on celestial fare, and delight, top-gallant delight, is the sensation with which the reader is most frequently familiar. There is a wild and wonderful fascination in the story against which no man may hope to secure himself into whose intellectual composition the faculty called fancy has in any degree entered. So surprising are many of the adventures recorded—so singular and unearthly are many of the scenes depicted, that there are occasions when the reader is disposed to believe that the whole book is one vast practical joke. We are half inclined to believe that the author is humbugging us, and with that suspicion comes its invariable accompaniment, a sense of offended dignity; but the spell of genius is upon us, and we are powerless to resist. The author’s radiant imagination enthrals us in a delicious bondage, and the tide of his animal spirits sweeps all doubts and misgivings triumphantly before it. We bolt down all events, however unlikely—all achievements, however impossible—all hard things, visible and invisible, never mind how knobby, as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun-flints.</p>
<p class="chapterHeadAk"><span class="bold">II. American Reviews</span></p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Morning Courier and New-York Enquirer</span></span><span class="bold">, November 14, 1851:</span> No American writer is more sure, at every reappearance, of a more cheerful welcome than the author of Typee. His purity and freshness of style and exquisite tact in imparting vividness and life-likeness to his sketches long since gained him hosts of admirers on both sides of the water. This book has all the attractiveness of any of its predecessors; in truth, it possesses more of a witching interest, since the author’s fancy has taken in it a wilder play than ever before. It is ostensibly taken up with whales and whalers, but a vast variety of characters and subjects figure in it, all set off with an artistic effect that irresistibly captivates the attention. The author writes with the gusto of true genius, and it must be a torpid spirit indeed that is not enlivened with the raciness of his humor and the redolence of his imagination.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the New York</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Literary World</span></span><span class="bold">, November 15, 1851:</span> Every reader throughout the United States has probably perused in the newspapers the account of a recent incident in the whale fishery [the attacking of the New Bedford whaleship <span class="italic">Ann Alexander</span> by a sperm <a id="page676"/>whale] which would stagger the mind by its extent of the marvellous, were it not paralleled by a well known case—that of the Essex of Nantucket, still authenticated by living witnesses….</p>
<p class="para">By a singular coincidence this extreme adventure is, even to very many of the details, the catastrophe of Mr. Melville’s new book, which is a natural-historical, philosophical, romantic account of the person, habits, manners, ideas of the great sperm whale; of his haunts and of his belongings; of his associations with the world of the deep, and of the not less remarkable individuals and combinations of individuals who hunt him on the oceans. Nothing like it has ever before been written of the whale; for no man who has at once seen so much of the actual conflict, and weighed so carefully all that has been recorded on the subject, with equal powers of perception and reflection, has attempted to write at all on it—the labors of Scoresby covering a different and inferior branch of the history. To the popular mind this book of Herman Melville, touching the Leviathan of the deep, is as much of a discovery in Natural History as was the revelation of America by Christopher Columbus in geography.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the Springfield, Massachusetts,</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Republican</span></span><span class="bold">, November 17, 1851:</span> “Moby Dick” is the name of a fabulous white whale of the Northern regions of the Pacific, and in this, his last book Mr Melville has woven around this cumbrous bulk of romance, a large and interesting web of narrative, information, and sketches of character and scenery, in a quaint though interesting style, and with an easy, rollicking freedom of language and structure, characteristic of himself. What the author does not know about the sea, is not worth knowing, and there is not an experience of sea life, but he has the happy power of surrounding with romance. This book, and all hitherto written by the author, are as much superior to the sea books of Marryatt, as are the latter to those of the blanket weeklies. But there is one painful thought connected with the tale. There is no Fayaway [the Marquesan girl loved by the protagonist of Melville’s first book, <span class="italic">Typee</span>] in it. Alas! fickle and forgetful Melville, that thou should’st ever forget the gentle native who gave herself to thee in her far-off, savage home, and take to wantoning with “the monsters of the bubbling deep!”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the New York</span> <span class="bold"> <span class="italic">Evangelist</span></span><span class="bold">, November 20, 1851:</span> Mr. Melville grows wilder and more untameable with every adventure. In Typee and Omoo, he began with the semblance of life and reality, though it was often but the faintest kind of semblance. As he advanced, he threw off the pretense of probability, and wandered from the verisimilitude of fiction into the mist and vagueness of poetry and fantasy, and now in this last venture, has reached the very limbo of eccentricity. From first to last, oddity is the <a id="page677"/>governing characteristic. The extraordinary descriptive powers which Typee disclosed, are here in full strength. More graphic and terrible portraitures of hair-breadth ’scapes we never read. The delineation of character, too, is exquisitely humorous, sharp, individual and never-to-be forgotten. The description of Father Mapple’s sermon is a powerful piece of sailor-oratory; and passages of great eloquence, and artistic beauty and force, are to be found everywhere. It will add to Mr. Melville’s repute as a writer, undoubtedly, and furnishes, incidentally, a most striking picture of sea life and adventures.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the New York</span> <span class="bold"> <span class="italic">Daily Tribune</span></span><span class="bold">, November 22, 1851:</span> Everybody has heard of the tradition which is said to prevail among the old salts of Nantucket and New-Bedford, of a ferocious monster of a whale, who is proof against all the arts of harpoonery, and who occasionally amuses himself with swallowing down a boat’s crew without winking. The present volume is a “Whaliad,” or the Epic of that veritable old leviathan, who “esteemeth iron as straw, and laughs at the spear, the dart, and the habergeon,” no one being able to “fill his skin with a barbed iron, or his head with fish-hooks.” Mr. Melville gives us not only the romance of his history, but a great mass of instruction on the character and habits of his whole race, with complete details of the wily stratagems of their pursuers.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the New York</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">Literary World</span></span><span class="bold">, November 22, 1851:</span> A difficulty in the estimate of this, in common with one or two other of Mr. Melville’s books, occurs from the double character under which they present themselves. In one light they are romantic fictions, in another statements of absolute fact. When to this is added that the romance is made a vehicle of opinion and satire through a more or less opaque allegorical veil, as particularly in the latter half of Mardi, and to some extent in this present volume, the critical difficulty is considerably thickened. It becomes quite impossible to submit such books to a distinct classification as fact, fiction, or essay. Something of a parallel may be found in Jean Paul’s German tales, with an admixture of Southey’s Doctor. Under these combined influences of personal observation, actual fidelity to local truthfulness in description, a taste for reading and sentiment, a fondness for fanciful analogies, near and remote, a rash daring in speculation, reckless at times of taste and propriety, again refined and eloquent, this volume of Moby Dick may be pronounced a most remarkable seadish—an intellectual chowder of romance, philosophy, natural history, fine writing, good feeling, bad sayings—but over which, in spite of all uncertainties, and in spite of the author himself, predominates his keen perceptive faculties, exhibited in vivid narration….</p>
<a id="page678"/>
<p class="para">The intense Captain Ahab is too long drawn out; something more of <span class="italic">him</span> might, we think, be left to the reader’s imagination. The value of this kind of writing can only be through the personal consciousness of the reader, what he brings to the book; and all this is sufficiently evoked by a dramatic trait or suggestion. If we had as much of Hamlet or Macbeth as Mr. Melville gives us of Ahab, we should be tired even of their sublime company. Yet Captain Ahab is a striking conception, firmly planted on the wild deck of the Pequod—a dark disturbed soul arraying itself with every ingenuity of material resources for a conflict at once natural and supernatural in his eye, with the most dangerous extant physical monster of the earth, embodying, in strongly drawn lines of mental association, the vaster moral evil of the world. The pursuit of the White Whale thus interweaves with the literal perils of the fishery—a problem of fate and destiny—to the tragic solution of which Ahab hurries on, amidst the wild stage scenery of the ocean. To this end the motley crew, the air, the sky, the sea, its inhabitants are idealized throughout. It is a noble and praiseworthy conception; and though our sympathies may not always accord with the train of thought, we would caution the reader against a light or hasty condemnation of this part of the work.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From the</span> <span class="bold"><span class="italic">United States Magazine and Democratic Review</span></span> <span class="bold">(New York), January 1852:</span> Mr. Melville is evidently trying to ascertain how far the public will consent to be imposed upon. He is gauging, at once, our gullibility and our patience. Having written one or two passable extravagancies, he has considered himself privileged to produce as many more as he pleases, increasingly exaggerated and increasingly dull. The field from which his first crops of literature were produced, has become greatly impoverished, and no amount of forcing seems likely to restore it to its pristine vigor. In bombast, in caricature, in rhetorical artifice—generally as clumsy as it is ineffectual—and in low attempts at humor, each one of his volumes has been an advance upon its predecessors, while, in all those qualities which make books readable, it has shown a decided retrogression from former efforts. Mr. Melville never writes naturally. His sentiment is forced. And in his attempts to display to the utmost extent his powers of “fine writing,” he has succeeded, we think, beyond his most sanguine expectations.</p>
<p class="para">The truth is, Mr. Melville has survived his reputation. If he had been contented with writing one or two books, he might have been famous, but his vanity has destroyed all his chances of immortality, or even of a good name with his own generation. For, in sober truth, Mr. Melville’s vanity is immeasurable. He will either be first among the book-making tribe, or he will be nowhere. He will centre all attention upon himself, or he will abandon the field of literature at once. From this morbid self-esteem, coupled with a most unbounded love of notoriety, spring all Mr. Melville’s efforts, all his rhetorical <a id="page679"/>paraNoIndent&gt;contortions, all his declamatory abuse of society, all his inflated sentiment, and all his insinuating licentiousness.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent"><span class="bold">From</span><span class="bold"> <span class="italic">To-day: A Boston Literary Journal</span></span><span class="bold">, January 10, 1852:</span> We have always hailed with joy the announcement of a new book by Mr. Melville whenever it has occurred since the time when we read his first book “Typee,” upon its appearance. But the expectations of pleasure excited by the memory of that book have always been disappointed as we have read those which have followed from the same pen. In fact the merit of Mr. Melville’s books has decreased almost in the order of their publication…. Perhaps the cause of our repeated disappointment has been that we over-rated “Typee. ” Our interest in that remarkable book, its exciting incidents and beautiful description was increased by its faithfulness even in slight particulars to what we knew was true with regard to the island where its scene was laid. Or perhaps the extraordinary success of that book caused the author to feel too secure in his laurels and to neglect too much his subsequent literary labors.</p>
<p class="para">The book before us is a new disappointment. It is a curious mixture of fact and fancy; of statistical and historical statements about the whale and the whale fishery, and a fictitious narrative of the adventures of a young man of unsettled habits and roving disposition, who embarks in a whale ship from Nantucket. Over this mixture is thrown a veil of a sort of dreamy philosophy and indistinct speculation just sufficient to obscure the value of the facts stated, and which in our opinion does not improve the quality of the tale.</p>
