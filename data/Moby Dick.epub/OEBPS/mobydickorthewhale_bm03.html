<p class="chapterOpenerText">Herman Melville has been lucky in his scholars, and <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, in particular, has received the minute and exacting attention of innumerable scholars over the last seventy years. The annotations that follow are relatively spare in comparison to all that is known about this novel, and they are meant merely to assist the reader in reading (and enjoying!) the text.</p>
<p class="para">For those who wish ampler annotations of passages and allusions, the notes to the Hendricks House edition of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> (1952), edited by Luther S. Mansfield and Howard P. Vincent, are especially full. The Bobbs-Merrill edition (1964), annotated by Charles Feidelson, is also very good. The Norton edition of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> (1967), edited by Harrison Hayford and Hershel Parker, prints a glossary of nautical terms, background and source material, and pertinent letters and contemporary reviews. The authoritative, CEAA-approved text of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> (1988), published by the Northwestern University Press and the Newberry Library and edited by Harrison Hayford, Hershel Parker, and G. Thomas Tanselle, is reproduced in this Penguin edition. The Northwestern-Newberry edition has a full discussion of textual variants and a long and very dense historical note that includes a full discussion of the circumstances of the composition and the reception of the novel. Jay Leyda’s two-volume <span class="italic">The Melville Log: A Documentary Life of Herman Melville 1819–1891</span> (1951 and 1969) remains an invaluable resource of information about Melville and his circumstances, and it is soon to appear in an expanded edition completed by Hershel Parker.</p>
<p class="para">The reader with a more specialized interest in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> or other Melville works may find one or another of the following books helpful: Kathleen E. Kier, <span class="italic">A Melville Encyclopedia: The Novels</span> (1990); Jill B. Gidmark, <span class="italic">Melville Sea Dictionary</span> (1982); Stuart M. Frank, <span class="italic">Herman Melville’s Picture Gallery: Sources and Types of the “Pictorial” Chapters of Moby-Dick</span> (1986); Mary Bercaw, <span class="italic">Melville’s Sources</span> (1987); Gail H. Coffler, <span class="italic">Melville’s Classical Allu<a id="page636"/>sions: A Comprehensive Index and Glossary</span> (1985); and Nathalia Wright, <span class="italic">Melville’s Use of the Bible</span> (1949). I have benefited from John Bryant’s “Texts and Discourse: The New <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>” in <span class="italic">Resources for American Literary Study</span> (1992) in making comments on important textual decisions made by the editors of the Northwestern-Newberry text of the novel. Eric Partridge’s <span class="italic">Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English</span> (1961) may also prove useful to those interested in Melville’s wordplay. Unless otherwise indicated, the definitions of slang expressions below are derived from Partridge.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Extracts:</span>The basic purpose of these eighty-one “Extracts” is to charge this narrative of whales and whaling with epic grandeur and significance. They are presented, more or less, in chronological order; the bibliographical information concerning both the sources of the Extracts and Etymology passages as well as Melville’s departures from the originals are discussed by the editors of the Northwestern/Newberry edition, pp. 813–830. Three of the extracts, it should be noted, have less to do with whales or whaling than with mutiny. One is the newspaper account of the “taking and retaking” of the ship <span class="italic">Hobomock</span> by “savages” (though Mansfield and Vincent point out that Melville must have confused the whaler <span class="italic">Sharon</span>, upon which such an insurrection did take place in 1842, with the <span class="italic">Hobomock</span>). The other two extracts are taken from William Lay and Cyrus Hussey’s <span class="italic">A Narrative of the Mutiny on Board the Ship Globe</span> (1828) and William Comstock’s <span class="italic">The Life of Samuel Comstock, the Bloody Mutineer</span> (1845). Both deal with an insurrection aboard the whaler <span class="italic">Globe</span> in 1824, a bloody mutiny led by an unquestionably barbarous and possibly insane Samuel Comstock, a ship’s officer, who killed the captain with an ax and became the ringleader of the revolt.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">sea-gudgeon:</span> Bait fish.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">sovereignest thing on earth is parmacetti:</span> Spermacetti; the fatty substance in the head of the sperm whale used for candles, cosmetics, and ointments.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Nescio quid sit:</span> “I do not know what it is.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Call me Ishmael:</span> The biblical Ishmael was the son of Abraham by his Egyptian servant Hagar. It is prophesied of him that “he will be a wild man; his hand <span class="italic">will be</span> against every man, and every man’s hand against him” (Gen. 16:12). The name was commonly associated with the figure of the exile. Of the several instances where this name appears, it is typically in the form of self-address. Only once is Ishmael called by that name; Captain Peleg refers to him as Ishmael in Chapter 16. Perhaps it is worth noting that Peter Coffin calls the narrator “Skrimshander” in Chapter 3, suggestive of his function as artist and yarn-spinner.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">hypos:</span> Melancholy; an abbreviation of hypochondria. The Greek <span class="italic">hu<a id="page637"/>pokhondria</span> signifies the belly or abdomen, the seat of melancholy. Ishmael’s self-described motivation and temperament in this opening chapter mark him as a melancholic. He remarks in Chapter 35 that “nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">city of the Manhattoes:</span> Manhattan Island, in New York.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Pythagorean maxim:</span> Pythagoreans followed the teachings of Pythagoras in order to purify and redeem the soul; among their strict observances was the avoidance of beans, which cause flatulence.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Tophet:</span> Hell.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">blackness of darkness:</span> Presumably the preacher’s sermon is about false teachers, described in the General Epistle of Jude as clouds without water, trees without fruit, “raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever” (Jude 12–13).</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Euroclydon:</span> The northeast wind that shipwrecked Saint Paul (Acts 27:14).</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">hob:</span> A shelf in or on the side of a fireplace for keeping things warm.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">skrimshander:</span> Or scrimshaw; bone or ivory elaborately and intricately carved with designs or pictures. Melville describes the process in Chapter 57.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet:</span> That is, the candles are in shrouds of melted tallow.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Bulkington:</span> Given this affectionate and heroic description, one may speculate that Bulkington was perhaps originally intended to play a larger role in the narrative than he in fact does. The novel changed its direction more than once while Melville was composing it, and this Virginian may have been designed to be a close companion to Ishmael. Also, though in a letter he himself had described his novel as merely “a romance of adventure,” there is a possibility that Melville had at one time envisioned a mutiny or some lesser confrontation aboard the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>. If so, Bulkington, by stature and temperament, was outfitted for such a role. He is not mentioned again, however, until Chapter 23, “The Lee Shore,” where he is permanently dismissed from the book.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">brown study:</span> A state of melancholic contemplation or perplexity.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Mt. Hecla:</span> Presumably Mount Hekla, a volcano in Iceland.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">’balmed New Zealand heads:</span> Readers sometimes mistake these for shrunken heads, perhaps because Peter Coffin says that Queequeg with his four heads on a string looks like someone with a “string of inions.” However, the heads were embalmed, not shrunken, and life size. In fact, we are told in Chapter 13 that the last, “broken” head is sold to a barber for a block, upon which the barber will prepare wigs.</p> 
<a id="page638"/>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">I’ll give ye a glim:</span> A glim is an eye; that is, “I’ll give you a peek or a glimpse.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">I vum:</span> I swear or vow.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">South American ponchos:</span> This mysterious “poncho” (as John Bryant has suggested to me) is more than likely the same sort of garment prepared for the mincers described in Chapter 95, “The Cassock.” In other words, Queequeg’s poncho is made from the skin of the whale’s penis; this may help to explain Ishmael’s reaction to his image in the mirror and his sudden anxiousness to get out of the thing.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Herr Alexander:</span> German magician who performed in New York City in the late 1840s.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">a lofty Ehrenbreitstein:</span> Like the fortified city of Quebec, high above the St. Lawrence River on a bluff, alluded to in the previous paragraph, Ehrenbreitstein is an elevated fortification on the Rhine.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">his head was phrenologically an excellent one:</span> Phrenology was the popular pseudo-science (or “semi-science,” as Melville will later call it) of studying character according to the conformation of the skull. Melville may have been indulging in a joke at the expense of phrenologists when he wrote that “Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically considered.” Phrenology books typically compared the heads of famous male Caucasians to women and the “lesser races,” to the benefit of white males. Thus, Africans, for example, were often diagnosed as strong in animalistic qualities but deficient in “Reason” Native Americans were characterized by “Secretiveness” women were typically seen as strong in the domestic affections such as “Amativeness” or “Ideality” but weak in “Individuality.” Few phrenologists, if any, were apt to compare favorably the head of a South Sea islander to George Washington. Melville comically applies this pseudo-science, along with its near relative physiognomy, to the face and skull of the whale in chapters 80 and 81.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards:</span> In 1698, Peter the Great worked as a common laborer in a naval yard in England in order to learn the art of shipbuilding.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">spile:</span> A wooden plug or bung.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">the three pirate powers:</span> Prussia, Russia, and Austria partitioned Poland in the late eighteenth century.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">opened a white church:</span> Spotted a white church.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">XXXIX Articles:</span> Articles of faith of the Church of England.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Pequod:</span> Or Pequot. Actually a Connecticut, not a Massachusetts, tribe, whose village was burned and the inhabitants slaughtered in 1637. The few Pequots that remained mingled with other New England tribes, so they may as well have been as “extinct as the ancient Medes,” <a id="page639"/>as Melville says. The name is appropriate, for the description of the ship and the prophecies that accumulate around the fated voyage mark the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> as a death ship.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">three old kings of Cologne:</span> The magi, whose remains were supposedly buried in the Cathedral of Cologne and whose skulls were publicly exhibited.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Thorkill-Hake:</span> Eleventh-century Icelandic hero, whose adventures were illustrated on his carved bedstead.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">she sported there a tiller:</span> Later (chapters 61 and 118), the “spokes” of the turnstile wheel the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> had apparently scorned are referred to. Evidently, this reference is a survival of some earlier conception of the ship.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Captain Peleg…</span>[<span class="italic">and</span>]<span class="italic">Bildad:</span> Peleg and Bildad are biblical names, the latter the sanctimonious comforter of Job. Melville’s Bildad is equally righteous, but his captains are a humorous pair. Surely one of the earliest versions of the “good cop and bad cop” confidence game, their pretended feud conspires to give Ishmael the 300th lay when he had hoped for a much handsomer share.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">stiver:</span> A Dutch coin.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king:</span> The biblical story of Ahab appears in I Kings 16–22. Most significant about the name is that Ahab was an idolator who “did evil in the sight of the Lord” and did “provoke” the Lord more than any king before him. Melville’s Ahab is fifty-eight years old and first went to sea when he was eighteen. He is a man who is “desperate moody, and savage,” and all bent on revenge. But Melville at least mollifies the biblical association by having Peleg inform Ishmael that Ahab has his “humanities,” that he is fairly recently married to a woman much younger than he and that they have a child.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">castor:</span> A small vial or cruet for condiments.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">pilau:</span> Or pilaf; a steamed rice dish, typically with meat or shellfish.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Quohog:</span> Peleg substitutes the name of a familiar thick-shelled clam for the more difficult Queequeg.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Quohog, his X mark:</span> John Bryant informs me that South Sea islanders typically reproduced a portion of their facial tattoos as a signature. Here Queequeg reproduces a “queer round figure” tattooed on his arm. In any event, typographical necessity rendered Queequeg’s mark as an X.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">for fear of after-claps:</span> Unexpected after-effects or sequels.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">the silver calabash he spat into:</span> Presumably the vestige of an earlier conception of Ahab’s impiety; the reference is never explained.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Elijah:</span> The biblical Elijah had prophesied Ahab’s destruction (I Kings 19–23). Ishmael dismisses the man’s forebodings as “humbug” <a id="page640"/>at the end of this chapter, but in Chapter 28, “Ahab,” his anxiousness about his captain is heightened by “the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitingly recurring to me, with a subtle energy.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">a small choice copy of Watts:</span> That is, a hymnal. Isaac Watts (1674–1748) was the author of hymns and some versions of the psalms. Bildad sings a Watts hymn as he pilots the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> to sea.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">my first kick:</span> The use of the word “first” is puzzling, for there are no future kicks. The editors of the Northwestern/Newberry edition speculate that Peleg, not Ahab, was originally conceived to be the captain of the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> and that further blows from him would be in keeping with his rough character. If in fact the two captains were about to separate for the length of the voyage, as they further observe, this may also help to explain why Bildad grasps Peleg’s hand and stands “gazing” into his face. This abusive “poke” may at one time have presaged further abuses and some sort of retaliation from the crew.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">thou sheep-head:</span> A talkative person; a chatterbox.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Cook or Vancouver:</span> James Cook (1728–1779) and George Vancouver (1758–1798), English explorers.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Krusenstern:</span> Adam Johann van Krusenstern (1770–1846), a Russian explorer.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">See subsequent chapters for something more on this head:</span> Meville’s note, referring to chapters 82 and 90.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">his old rigadig tunes:</span> Possibly rigadoon; rapid, double-metered tunes.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">an Ahasuerus to behold:</span> Biblical king of Persia who reigned from India “even unto Ethiopia” (Esther 1:1)</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">An Anacharsis Clootz deputation:</span> In 1790 the German nobleman Jean Baptiste Clootz appeared with a gathered deputation of foreigners before the French National Assembly to demonstrate the universal endorsement of the French Revolution.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Black little Pip—he never did:</span> In the American edition, after this passage the phrase “oh, no! he went before” appeared. It was canceled in the English edition, but at some point in the composition of the novel Melville evidently foresaw Pip’s death before the sinking of the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>. Pip does go mad, but he does not die before the rest. Nevertheless, the tone and quality of Ishmael’s lamentation in response to Pip’s untimely death is evident even here.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">“He has a quiver of ’em”:</span> Another discrepancy, since Ahab would not have had to instruct the carpenter to make him a new pegleg, as he does in Chapter 106, if he had a quiver of extras in his cabin.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Enter Ahab; to him, Stubb:</span> This is the first instance of dramatic technique that will become more common (for example, chapters 37–39, 70–72, and 77), as the narrative acquires and emphasizes its dramatic and particularly Shakespearean qualities.</p>
<a id="page641"/>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Tic-Dolly-row:</span> Or <span class="italic">tic douloureux</span>; literally a sad or painful twitching, here indicative of a troubled conscience.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry">’<span class="italic">Slid!:</span> God’s lid; an oath.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Many are the men:</span> Of this list of whaling “authorities,” the ones who proved most useful to Melville and from whose writings he borrowed most heavily are Thomas Beale, <span class="italic">The Natural History of the Sperm Whale</span> (1839); J. Ross Browne, <span class="italic">Etchings of a Whaling Cruise</span> (1846); William Scoresby, Jr., <span class="italic">An Account of the Arctic Regions, with a History and Description of the Northern Whale-Fishery</span> (1820). For an extensive treatment of Melville’s use of whaling sources, see Howard Vincent’s <span class="italic">The Trying-Out of Moby-Dick</span> (1949) or the notes to the Hendricks House edition of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">warm bilocular heart:</span> Heart having two chambers.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem:</span> “A penis which enters the female who gives milk from her breasts.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">jure meritque:</span> “Justly and deservedly from the law of nature.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Duodecimo Whale:</span> These are printer’s terms for the size of books, the folio being the largest, the duodecimo the smallest. Melville omits the quarto from his taxonomy for reasons stated later in the chapter.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe:</span> Actually the blue or “sulphur bottom” whale is considerably larger than the sperm whale. Whether or not Melville knew this is uncertain; Ishmael later says that he has seen this whale at too “great a distance” to study him. In any event, the grand scale of this epic quest required that the sperm whale Moby Dick be deemed the largest creature in the seas.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">gnomon-like fin:</span> That is, the fin is like the perpendicular post on a sundial.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back:</span> “Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward” (Isa. 38:8), Because the whale does not remain stationary, the shadow cast by his fin is erratic.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">with rope-walks of line:</span> Long, narrow alleyways where ropes are made.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Black Letter tells me:</span> That is, Richard Hakluyt’s <span class="italic">Principal Navigations</span> (1598).</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">binnacle:</span> The stand in which the ship’s compass sits.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon:</span> “Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand” (Dan. 5:1).</p>
<a id="page642"/>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">that wild Logan of the woods:</span> John Logan, a defiant Shawnee leader who, intent on revenge for the massacre of his family by whites, refused to participate in peace talks.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Captain Sleet:</span> A parodic reference to William Scoresby Jr., whose father had evidently invented the crow’s nest and from whose <span class="italic">An Account of the Artic Regions</span> Melville had borrowed heavily in writing <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">instead of Bowditch:</span> Nathaniel Bowditch (1773–1838), American mathematician and astronomer.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Ten thousand blubber hunters sweep over thee in vain:</span> Melville’s hypothetical young philosopher adapts Byron’s “Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain” to his own circumstance.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Wickliff’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes:</span> The martyred reformer William Wycliffe was disinterred and his body burned in 1428. His ashes were deposited in a brook and flowed into the ocean.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Over Descartian vortices you hover:</span> This often cited passage has a double, perhaps a triple, significance. Most obviously it is a commentary on Cartesian dualism, for Ishmael’s reveries may be permanently interrupted by a false step. Second, the phrase refers to René Descartes’s (1596–1650) theory that all motion occurs in circular patterns and that the universe is inhabited by countless vortices. Finally, there is the residual suggestion of the “Cartesian devil diver”—a philosophical parlor toy consisting of a figure in a glass tube partly filled with water, the open end covered with elastic or rubber; as the elastic is depressed the diver sinks, and upon release the diver rises. Here Ishmael imagines a diver who sinks “no more to rise for ever.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">St. Vitus’ imp:</span> St. Vitus’s dance, or chorea, a nervous disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking, though Ahab’s subsequent reference to “ague” suggests the shaking is due to fever. Actually, his shaking is likely due to his own passionate hate of the whale that he has transmitted to his crew.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Iron Crown of Lombardy:</span> Crown used at the coronation of Holy Roman Emperors.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes:</span> Jem (“Deaf”) Burke and William Thompson (nicknamed “Bendigo”), early nineteenth-century prize-fighters.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">I twigged it:</span> I observed it.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Here’s a carcase:</span> A carcass. The sense here is that Stubb has lost his character or substance since his dream in the “Queen Mab” chapter. He no longer has the will to rebel or to oppose Ahab.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay:</span> Before we go to bed.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Seeva:</span> Shiva or Siva, member of the Hindu triad consisting <a id="page643"/>of Brahma (the Creator), Vishnu (the Preserver), and Shiva (the Destroyer).</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Moby Dick:</span> Melville was surely aware of the legend of the white whale Mocha Dick and gave his own mythical creation a modified version of that name, though according to the tale Mocha Dick was in fact killed. Melville apparently meant from the beginning that his white whale should survive.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">this monomania:</span> Given Ishmael’s casual and familiar use of this term, it is perhaps surprising to learn that in 1851 the word was of fairly recent origin; it was coined in 1823 by the French psychiatrist Jean Esquirol. James C. Prichard in the <span class="italic">Cyclopedia of Practical Medicine</span> (1833) wrote that the term monomania “has been adopted of late times instead of melancholia” (OED). The <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopedia</span> (1843), which provided Melville with other source material for <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, observed that along with the obsessive character of the monomaniac there is “generally combined with the delusion a morbid state of the moral feelings” (OED). Though Melville often describes Ahab as obsessive and morbid, he never uses the word <span class="italic">melancholy</span> in reference to him.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Roman halls of Thermes:</span> The Hôtel de Cluny was a medieval palace in Paris; beneath it were Roman baths <span class="italic">(thermae)</span>.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">so like a Caryatid, he patiently sits:</span> A caryatid is a sculptural supporting column, typically in the form of a female, not a male, and standing, not sitting.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">murderous savage Annawon:</span> The Wampanoag leader Annawon was actually pursued and captured by Captain Benjamin Church in 1676. Lieutenant Colonel William Butler pursued another Indian leader in 1778.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Langsdorff’s Voyages:</span> Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff’s <span class="italic">Voyages and Travels in Various Parts of the World</span> was published in 1813.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">I can’t see three seas off:</span> That is, he can’t see more than three waves off.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Fits? yes, give him fits:</span> In nineteenth-century slang, to give one fits is to make one suffer a humiliating defeat.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">the devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours:</span> In Genesis 6:1–4, the sons of God “came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare <span class="italic">children</span> to them.” But the authors of the unca<a id="page644"/>nonical Book of Enoch and Book of Jubilees interpret this scripture to mean that devils visited the earth, and their children were unholy and destructive.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">As if the waves had been fullers:</span> Fullers are those who beat and shrink cloth during its manufacture in order to make the fabric more dense.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it:</span> “The Town-Ho’s Story,” some Melville scholars believe, is a vestige of Melville’s earlier conception of his novel; hence, as this passage hints, this is a “twice told tale.” In any event, the story continues some of the foreshadowings in earlier chapters that are never satisfied in the main narrative. Harrison Hayford has argued persuasively that the early plans for Peleg as an abusive captain of the <span class="italic">Pequod</span> survive in the character of Radney and that Bulkington was meant to play the defiant role played here by Steelkilt.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">St. Mark!—St. Dominic:</span> St. Mark, the patron saint of Venice; St. Dominic, founder of the Dominican order, is the patron saint of the Cathedral of Lima.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">behind the barricade:</span> That is, as Parisians behind barricades during the street fighting that occurred during the republican revolutions in nineteenth-century France.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">mince ye up for the try-pots:</span> Large pots used for rendering whale oil; this process is dramatically described in Chapter 96, “The Try-Works.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales:</span> This and the next two chapters deal with pictorial representations of whales; Ishmael’s treatment of this subject is progressive in the sense that he deals with the most fantastic representations first and moves toward the more authentic depictions. The lavishly illustrated <span class="italic">Herman Melville’s Picture Gallery: Sources and Types of the “Pictorial” Chapters of Moby-Dick</span> (1986), by Stuart M. Frank, includes the original or analogous representations to which Melville refers, and it is a delightful and instructive gloss on these chapters.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of the marines:</span> That is, for those gullible enough to believe it. “Marine” was often used to signify an ignorant seaman; hence the slang expression “Tell it to the marines” means tell it to someone credulous enough to believe you.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">the live ground opened and swallowed them up forever:</span> If the Lord “make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up…then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord” (Num. 16:30).</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">the six burghers of Calais before King Edward:</span> The six who, in 1347, voluntarily responded to King Edward III’s promise to spare Calais in exchange for the lives of six notable citizens and appeared with ropes around their necks.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Mazeppa:</span> Byronic character who is tied to a wild horse.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">some young bucks…by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf’s head from their own heads:</span> Another extended pun; a “calf” is slang for a brainless person.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">formerly:</span> The Northwestern-Newberry editors have changed the copytext’s “formally” to “formerly” on the grounds that it better conforms to the sense of this and the next sentence. It is possible, however, as John Bryant observes, that “formally” was in fact Melville’s intention, since it emphasizes the hypocrisy of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Agassiz:</span> Louis Agassiz (1807–1873), Swiss-born naturalist and geologist who taught at Harvard after 1848.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">There are other ghosts than the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them:</span> Actually Samuel Johnson (1709–84), among others, investigated the spirit rappings on Cock Lane and exposed the fraud.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">opening of the seventh vial:</span> The seventh vial of wrath recorded in Revelation 16:17–21; when it was poured into the air it brought forth the destruction of thunder, lightning, earthquakes, and hailstorms.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Ahab’s feet:</span> Melville’s biographer Leon Howard hypothesized that Ahab’s pegleg may have been a late addition to the novel and that this reference to Ahab’s “feet” may be a vestige of that earlier conception. Ahab is often unusually active, even nimble, for a man with one leg.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">jalap:</span> Mexican plant whose root is used as a cathartic.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years:</span> Though Melville has changed his allusions from Locke and Kant to Stoics, Plato, and Spinoza, this is essentially a continuation of the distinction made earlier between the practical and empiricist Right Whale and the transcendental idealist and absolutist Sperm Whale.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien:</span> The Isthmus of Panama; Melville imagines the sperm whale accomplishing an engineering feat that, in fact, will not be achieved until the completion of the Panama Canal in 1914.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">the dread goddess’s veil at Sais:</span> In Schiller’s poem “The Veiled Statue at Sais,” a youth seeking to learn of Truth lifts the veil of a statue in the temple of Athena. What he saw there is not disclosed, but he becomes an unhappy man and dies young.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Physiognomist or Phrenologist:</span> Physiognomy is the examination of character according to the study of faces; Johann Lavater (1741–1801) was a physiognomist. Phrenology refers to the study of character according to the conformation of the skull; Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) and his “disciple” Johan Spurzheim (1776–1832) were phrenologists.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics:</span> Jean François Champollion (1790–1832), the French Egyptologist who deciphered the Rosetta Stone.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">duff:</span> A pudding made of flour, raisins, and water; “duff days” were Thursday and Sunday, when this mixture was served to the crew instead of meat.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Dutch dogger:</span> An awkward Dutch vessel and, by extension, a derogatory reference to those who sail in her; similarly, “butter-boxes” (below) refers both to a Dutch craft and Dutchmen. Melville returns to this theme in Chapter 101 when he remarks on the astonishing amount of butter and cheese unctuous Dutch sailors consumed.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">To</span> gally, <span class="italic">or</span> gallow<span class="italic">…in the New World:</span> The editors of the Northwestern-Newberry edition of the novel have added this note, which appeared in the English edition but not the American. As Harrison Hayford points out, the style, substance, and broad humor indicate that this note is almost surely Melville’s, not some addition made by an editor for an English audience, and therefore properly belongs in an authoritative text.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">more hominum:</span> In the manner of men.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">en bon point:</span> Probably <span class="italic">embonpoint</span>, “corpulent.”</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Republican slaves:</span> That is, slaves in a republic, as in the United States, and perhaps a sardonic reference to the recently enacted Fugitive Slave Law (1850).</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">John Bull…Brother Jonathan:</span> John Bull is England, Brother Jonathan is the United States, which annexed Texas in 1845.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">What at last will Mexico be to the United States?:</span> An interesting and, in 1851, perhaps not so farfetched conclusion to this brief survey of colonial expansion. Between 1845 and the end of the Mexican-American War and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848, the United States acquired Texas, California, much of Colorado, Utah, most of Arizona, and New Mexico. Not until the Gadsden Purchase (1853) were the bitter boundary disputes settled and the present limits of the continental U.S. established.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">a Crappo that is content with our leavings:</span> French <span class="italic">crapaud</span>, “toad.” That is, a derogatory term for the French analogous to the more familiar epithet “frogs,” but also punningly in this context, meaning one that will settle for our “leavings,” or crap.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">the man that wandereth…in the congregation of the dead:</span> Proverbs 21:16</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">metempsychosis:</span> Transmigration of souls. Pythagoras was a believer in this form of reincarnation; here Ishmael imagines himself two thousand years later instructing Pythagoras, now reborn as a novice sailor.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Belshazzar’s awful writing:</span> A divine warning written on the wall. Daniel interpreted the words for the King of Babylon and was rewarded with a third of the kingdom (Dan. 5). Melville quotes those mysterious words—“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin”—in Chapter 119.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Jimini:</span> Slang; also spelled “gemminy” or “jimminy.” An expression of surprise.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">testing cruise:</span> The Northwestern-Newberry editors have emended the phrase from the copytext’s “tasting cruise” in order to bring it into conformity with the notion of a “noble experimental cruise” mentioned in the next sentence. John Bryant, while accepting the change, speculates that “tasting” may in fact have been Melville’s original intention and meant for a pun.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">anti-scorbutic:</span> That is, a cure for or preventative of scurvy; since the “fresh fare” is probably weevils, the bread fails of its purpose.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles:</span> As penalty for his overpraise of the Syracusan tyrant Dionysius, Damocles was invited to a banquet and seated beneath a sword hanging by a hair.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence:</span> The bones found on the Alabama plantation were first identified as those of a reptile (<span class="italic">Basilosaurus</span>, or king lizard), but the British naturalist Sir Richard Owen identified it as an extinct species of whale. In 1845 Albert Koch assembled a very large skeleton using some of these bones along with others not from the original discovery and publicly exhibited it in New York and Boston as authentic. Evidently, the public was as credulous as were Judge Creagh’s slaves.</p>
<a id="page649"/>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Thames Tunnels of Whales:</span> In London, the 1,300-foot-long tunnel beneath the Thames was opened in 1843. In Chapter 108, Ahab employs the same figure as a comparison to the desired girth of the chest of his imagined “complete man.”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">his ivory limb…all but pierced his groin:</span> This later accident explains why Ahab kept to his cabin before and after the departure of the <span class="italic">Pequod</span>, and it supplies a deeper motive for revenge; for he is not only “dismasted” but apparently unmanned as well.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">multum in parvo:</span> Much in little.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">you old Smut:</span> “Smut!” or “brother smut,” a slang expression meaning “ditto” or “same to you.” The comic sense is that the carpenter, who like Ahab is given to soliloquizing, is upbraiding himself. The pairing of Ahab and the carpenter is deliberate and revealing. Both have a “subtle something” within them, and Ahab seems to recognize this, since he asks the carpenter whether he does not feel “some entire, living, thinking thing” standing where he now stands. The difference, of course, is that the carpenter’s doubled self, as opposed to Ahab’s, is benign and attributable to mere dotage.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">taking altitudes on it:</span> Double reference: using a quadrant and arrogantly indulging in elevated moods, such as Ahab has just done with the carpenter.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">up Burtons and break out:</span> Hoist the casks out of stowage.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Mother Carey’s chickens:</span> According to Eric Partridge, a slang nautical expression for snow; here the sparks rain down on Ahab like snowflakes. But also, more conventionally, a slang expression for petrels, to which Ahab alludes when he speaks of the sparks as birds of omen.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”:</span> “I baptize thee not in the name of the Father, but in the name of the Devil.” Melville remarked in a letter to Hawthorne (June 29, 1851) that this is the secret “motto” of his book.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">“Oh, grassy glades!…we must there to learn it.”:</span> The editors of the Northwestern-Newberry text, quite properly, have added the quotation marks to this paragraph. Neither the American or the English editions of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> printed these quotation marks, but the context makes clear that the paragraph is spoken by Ahab, not Ishmael, as some critics have assumed.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Asphaltites:</span> The Dead Sea.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">corpusants:</span> Luminous balls of electrical energy.</p>

<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Aroostook:</span> County in Maine.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Cruppered with a coffin:</span> A crupper is a leather strap attached to a saddle and looped around a horse’s tail; here, the sense is being saddled with the job of caulking a coffin.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">Middle aisle of a church! What’s here?:</span> The sense here is, “What’s this, the middle aisle of a church, that a coffin should be in the middle of the deck?”</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not:</span> “A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they <span class="italic">were</span> not” (Jer. 31:15).</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry"><span class="italic">base of the Eddystone:</span> Base of the lighthouse on the Eddystone reef in the English Channel.</p>
