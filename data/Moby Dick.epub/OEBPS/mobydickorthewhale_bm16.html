<p class="footnote" id="footnote3"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch32.html#ke3">*</a></sup>I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamantins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote4"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch32.html#ke4">*</a></sup>Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its diminished form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote5"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch42.html#ke5">*</a></sup>With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only arises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.<br/>      As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence<span class="italic">Requiem</span> denominating the mass itself, and any other funereal music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him<span class="italic">Requin</span> .</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote6"><span class="footnotePara"><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch42.html#ke6">†</a> I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! I never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.<br/>     I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.<br/>     But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wingfolding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote7"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch44.html#ke7">*</a></sup>Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to show the number of days on which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.”</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote8"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch45.html#ke8">*</a></sup>The following are extracts from Chase’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact manæuvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.”<br/>     Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and<span class="italic">the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale</span> , wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.”<br/>     In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “<span class="italic">the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote9"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch51.html#ke9">*</a></sup>The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote10"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch54.html#ke10">*</a></sup>The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote11"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch58.html#ke11">*</a></sup>That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote12"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch61.html#ke12">*</a></sup>It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cutwater formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharp-pointed New York pilot-boat.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote13"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch61.html#ke13">*</a></sup>Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote14"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch64.html#ke14">*</a></sup>A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote15"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch66.html#ke15">*</a></sup>The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote16"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch72.html#ke16">*</a></sup>The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote17"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch75.html#ke17">*</a></sup>This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote18"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch77.html#ke18">*</a></sup>Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both sides.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote19"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch86.html#ke19">*</a></sup>Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote20"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch87.html#ke20">*</a></sup>To<span class="italic">gally</span> , or<span class="italic">gallow</span> , is to frighten excessively,—to confound with fright. It is an old Saxon word. It occurs once in Shakspere:—</span></p><div class="extract">
<p class="extractVerse1">“The wrathful skies</p>
<p class="extractVerse"><span class="italic">Gallow</span>the very wanderers of the dark,</p>
<p class="extractVerse">And make them keep their caves</p>
<p class="extractSource"><span class="italic">Lear</span>, Act III. sc ii.</p></div>
<p class="para">To common land usages, the word is now completely obsolete. When the polite landsman first hears it from the gaunt Nantucketer, he is apt to set it down as one of the whaleman’s self-derived savageries. Much the same is it with many other sinewy Saxonisms of this sort, which emigrated to the New-England rocks with the noble brawn of the old English emigrants in the time of the Commonwealth. Thus, some of the best and furthest-descended English words—the etymological Howards and Percys—are now democratised, nay, plebeianised—so to speak—in the New World.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote21"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch87.html#ke21">*</a></sup>The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute<span class="italic">more hominum</span><span class="xrefInternal" id="kch87_e2"><a href="mobydickorthewhale_bm14.html#ch87_e2"><sup>e2</sup></a></span> .</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote22"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch95.html#ke22">*</a></sup>Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote23"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch109.html#ke23">*</a></sup>In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.</span></p>
<p class="footnote" id="footnote24"><span class="footnotePara"><sup><a href="mobydickorthewhale_ch133.html#ke24">*</a></sup>This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.</span></p>
