<p class="spaceBreak"> </p>
<p class="paraNoIndent">An essay on Herman Melville’s <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> in popular culture could not have been written in the nineteenth century. In the forty years between the book’s publication in 1851 and Melville’s death in 1891, there were no editions other than the first English edition published by Richard Bentley and the first American edition published by Harper &amp; Brothers. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> languished far from public notice, unknown, uncherished, unloved. The book so permeates popular culture in the early twenty-first century that its initial fate is hard to imagine. That Melville never knew how much his masterpiece would mean to so many readers fills one with a melancholic sadness.</p> 
<p class="para">There is, however, one bright spot in that sadness. Melville dedicated <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> to Nathaniel Hawthorne, “In token of my admiration for his genius” (xxxv). When Hawthorne received a copy of the book, he wrote to Melville in a letter now lost. Melville’s response, however, has come down to posterity. Melville calls Hawthorne’s epistle: “your joy-giving and exultation-breeding letter” and affirms, “A sense of unspeakable security is in me this moment, on account of your having understood.” He continues:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractTextNoIndent">I have written a wicked book, and feel spotless as the lamb. Ineffable socialities are in me. I would sit down and dine with you and all the gods in old Rome’s Pantheon…. You were archangel enough to despise the imperfect body, and embrace the soul.</p>
</div>
<p class="paraNoIndent">He finally signs the letter “Herman,” but, unable to break away, adds, “I can’t stop yet” and writes a further two paragraphs (Letter of November [17?], 1851). That the person whose approbation he most desired understood what he had created in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> was a solace to Melville himself and to the many Melville scholars that have followed since.</p>
<p class="para">After Melville died in 1891, his literary executor, Arthur Stedman, supervised what has since been called the “deathbed edition ” of four of Melville’s works, including <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> (1892). Three other editions were published in the thirty years between Melville’s death and 1921. But Melville had not yet been “discovered. ”</p>
<a id="page683"/>
<p class="para">Everything changed in 1921, the beginning of the Melville Revival. In that year, Raymond Weaver published <span class="italic">Herman Melville: Mariner and Mystic</span>. As biography it is lacking, for Weaver took Melville’s early writings as literally true and copied vast amounts of them into his biography. But <span class="italic">Mariner and Mystic</span> is extraordinarily important for the interest it aroused in Melville and his writings. Weaver went on to edit the Constable, or Standard, edition of Melville’s works, in which <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> appeared in 1922. That edition included the first appearance of Melville’s last work, <span class="italic">Billy Budd</span>, and it remains the only complete edition of Melville’s works.</p>
<p class="para">Since 1921, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>’s fame has continued to expand. Despite the fact that the book is as politically incorrect as possible, centering, as it does, on the killing of whales, its reputation has only increased. Even those who have never read the book recognize its basic iconography: the one-legged man in a top hat and often carrying a harpoon, the white whale, the whaleship.</p>
<p class="para">The first film version of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> was the silent black-and-white <span class="italic">The Sea Beast</span>, released in 1926. John Barrymore stars as Ahab (here Captain Ahab Ceeley), but the writers worried that he did not have a strong enough reason for hunting the white whale; he was therefore given an evil half brother, Derek Ceeley, and a love interest, Esther Harper, whom Derek tries to steal from Ahab. John Barrymore met Dolores Costello, who plays Esther, just before the filming of <span class="italic">The Sea Beast</span> and later married her; they are the grandparents of Drew Barrymore.</p>
<p class="para">In 1930, a sound version was released, again starring John Barrymore but now entitled <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span>. Ahab now loves Faith Mapple, Father Mapple’s daughter played by Joan Bennett, but Faith must overcome her horror at his missing leg. In the film’s initial sequence, the cover of a book entitled <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> slowly opens to reveal the first pages of the novel—but the screenwriter has rewritten the book’s beginning, despite putting Melville’s name on it.</p>
<p class="para">That two film versions so quickly followed the beginning of the Melville Revival shows the growing popularity of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, but the ease with which the screenwriters changed the plot starkly points out how little the book itself was actually read. “Call me Ishmael,” the first sentence of <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, is now so widely known that if a book entitled <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> opened on screen to reveal any other sentence, it would be greeted with uproarious laughter.</p>
<p class="para">As the 1920s and 1930s progressed, the literary world—writers, critics, English professors—more and more came to view <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> as a classic. Two years after Weaver’s <span class="italic">Mariner and Mystic</span>, D. H. Lawrence published <span class="italic">Studies in Classic American Literature</span> (1923), which included two chapters on Melville. Lawrence’s consideration of Melville reflects more on Lawrence himself than on his subject. For instance, he writes of <a id="page684"/>Melville: “There is something curious about real blue-eyed people. They are never quite human, in the good classic sense, human as brown-eyed people are human: the human of the living humus” (chapter 10). This is certainly not literary scholarship as we understand it, but it did bring notice to Melville. Lawrence has chapters on Benjamin Franklin, J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur, Edgar Allan Poe, Richard Henry Dana, Walt Whitman, and two chapters each on James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Melville. Today all remain major figures in the American literary canon. Therefore, the fact that by 1923 Lawrence included Melville is highly significant.</p>
<p class="para">Important scholars continued to write on Melville: Lewis Mumford, <span class="italic">Herman Melville</span> (1929); Yvor Winters, <span class="italic">Maule’s Curse</span> (1938); F. O. Matthiessen, <span class="italic">American Renaissance</span> (1941); Van Wyck Brooks, <span class="italic">The Times of Melville and Whitman</span> (1947); Newton Arvin, <span class="italic">Herman Melville</span> (1950); Lawrance Thompson, <span class="italic">Melville’s Quarrel with God</span> (1952); Charles Feidelson Jr., <span class="italic">Symbolism and American Literature</span> (1953); C. L. R. James, <span class="italic">Mariners, Renegades and Castaways</span> (1953); Perry Miller, <span class="italic">The Raven and the Whale</span> (1956); Richard Chase, <span class="italic">The American Novel and Its Tradition</span> (1957); Milton R. Stern, <span class="italic">The Fine Hammered Steel of Herman Melville</span> (1957); Leslie Fiedler, <span class="italic">Love and Death in the American Novel</span> (1960); H. Bruce Franklin, <span class="italic">The Wake of the Gods: Melville’s Mythology</span> (1963); John Seelye, <span class="italic">Melville: The Ironic Diagram</span> (1970); Henry Nash Smith, “The Madness of Ahab” in <span class="italic">Democracy and the Novel</span> (1978); Carolyn Karcher, <span class="italic">Shadow over the Promised Land</span> (1980); Robert K. Martin, <span class="italic">Hero, Captain, Stranger</span> (1986); Wai-Chee Dimock, <span class="italic">Empire for Liberty</span> (1989); and many more that I have left out. Black and white, male and female, straight and gay—the writers on Melville spanned all identifications.</p>
<p class="para">Poets and writers, too, wrote about Melville. Two of the most important contributions were Charles Olson’s book <span class="italic">Call Me Ishmael</span> (1947) and Toni Morrison’s “Unspeakable Things Unspoken: The Afro-American Presence in American Literature,” published in the <span class="italic">Michigan Quarterly Review</span> (1989).</p>
<p class="para">The Melville Revival elevated <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> to the literary canon, which led to more and more students reading the book. References to <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> then became ubiquitous. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> entered popular culture as a result, just as Mark Twain’s <span class="italic">Huckleberry Finn</span> and James Fenimore Cooper’s <span class="italic">The Deerslayer</span> did. These books became widely familiar as they were more widely read in school. They became part of popular culture largely because they were extensively assigned as readings, and not because they were read by the general public for the sheer fun, as were Melville’s <span class="italic">Typee</span>, Twain’s <span class="italic">Tom Sawyer</span>, and Cooper’s <span class="italic">The Last of the Mohicans</span>.</p>
<p class="para">The 1956 film <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span> solidified <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>’s place in popular culture. John Huston directed the film, Ray Bradbury wrote the screenplay, and Gregory Peck played <a id="page685"/>the role of Ahab. Huston won four awards as best director, including awards from the Directors Guild of America and the New York Film Critics Circle. Surprisingly, during a meeting to discuss the screenplay, Bradbury informed Huston that he had “never been able to read the damned thing [<span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>].”According to Sam Weller’s biography, <span class="italic">The Bradbury Chronicles</span> (2005), there was much tension and anger between Huston and Bradbury during the 1953–54 making of the film, allegedly due to Huston’s bullying attitude and attempts to tell Bradbury how to do his job. Bradbury’s novel <span class="italic">Green Shadows, White Whale</span> (1992) includes a fictionalized version of his writing the screenplay; his short story “Banshee” (1984) is another fictionalized account of what it was like to work with Huston. <span class="italic">Mad Magazine</span> published a satire of the movie, in which “Father Maplesyrup, an Ex-Sea Captain ” turned preacher gives a sermon on Jonah and the whale and, according to the magazine, gives away the whole plot. With the 1956 film, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> was firmly established in both popular culture and the literary world.</p>
<p class="para">Melville’s place within the literary canon, however, was a curse as well as a blessing. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> entered the public imagination as a tremendously long and impenetrable novel. To have read <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, or to have been forced to read <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> as a student, particularly a high school student, still elicits sympathy and compassion as often as respect. The sheer physical size of the book is played upon in the film <span class="italic">Fried Green Tomatoes</span> (1991). Upon being questioned about how she could have lied in court after swearing on the Bible, Ruth responds, “Well, if that judge had looked any closer, he’d have seen that it was a copy of <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span>.” The book is so thick, so somber, it could be mistaken for the Bible. Why would anyone read it? In the film <span class="italic">Major League</span>(1989), Willie Mays Hayes, looking over Jake’s shoulder, asks, “Moby Dick? What you reading that for? ” In the film <span class="italic">Deep Impact</span> (1998), Fish, reading to Oren Monash, who is blinded and strapped to a bunk in a spacecraft, says, “Well, let’s get started. Moby Dick. Chapter 1. ‘Call me Ishmael…’” Dr. James Wilson asks in episode 2.17, “All In,” of <span class="italic">House M.D.</span> (2004): “Have you read ‘Moby Dick’?” And when Macaulay Culkin goes into the library in <span class="italic">The Pagemaster</span> (1994), one of the books that engulfs him is, of course, <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>.</p>
<p class="para">Much has also been made of the second word in the book’s title. In <span class="italic">Matilda</span>(1996), the child’s father, played by Danny DeVito, assumes that <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> must be trash because of its title. Matilda answers: “It’s not trash, Daddy, it’s lovely. It’s called Moby Dick by Herman Melville. ” And in <span class="italic">Wedding Crashers</span> (2005), Secretary Cleary says, “Well, the guy wants to run for president, he thinks Moby Dick is a venereal disease.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>’s characters, too, have spawned film characters, perhaps most notably the figure of Khan in <span class="italic">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</span> (1982). Khan makes use of <a id="page686"/>Ahab’s words in stating why he must defeat Captain Kirk: “He tasks me. He tasks me and I shall have him! I’ll chase him ’round the moons of Nibia and ’round the Antares Maelstrom and ’round Perdition’s flames before I give him up!” Just in case the viewer has missed the connection, the camera at one point pans around the inside of the downed spacecraft in which Khan lives, and there on a bookshelf stand <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, and <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>—the latter being two of the most important written sources for <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> not only permeates the world of film and television; it also permeates cartoons. Gary Larson’s <span class="italic">The Far Side</span> often revels in <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> allusions. In one, a writer sits tearing out his hair, while sheets of paper fall from his desk: “Chapter 1 / Call me Bill,” “Chapter 1 / Call me Al,” “Chapter 1 / Call me Larry,” “Chapter 1 / Call me Warren,” “Chapter 1 / Call me Roger” (1982). In another, Moby Dick, driving a truck in what appears to be New York City, has rear-ended a car, and out of the car appears a top hat, a harpoon, and a wooden leg. Moby mutters, “Crimony! Millions of people in this city, and look who I rear-end ” (1986). In a third cartoon, entitled “Moby’s parents,” an older female whale in an apron says to an older male whale sitting in an armchair, “Henry! Look!…It’s a letter from Richard” (1986). In a fourth, a little boy crouches in front of a tank full of many small black fish and one white fish with a sign reading “ Tropical Fish 15¢. ” His mother asks, “Well, Little Ahab…Which one is it going to be? ” (n.d.). And perhaps my favorite, a man in a crow’s nest on a whaleship cries out, “ The white whale! The whiiiiiite wh…No, no…My mistake!…A black whale! A regular blaaaaaaack whale!” (1984).</p>
<p class="para">Charles Schulz’s <span class="italic">Peanuts</span> shows his fondness for <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>. In a 1976 strip, Lucy sits writing a book report: “This is my report on Dick Moby.” Charlie Brown tells her, “That’s wrong you know.” She stares at her report for a moment, then asks, “How about Richard Moby?” In an earlier (1971) strip, Charlie Brown tells Snoopy, sitting atop his doghouse with a typewriter, “You know what Herman Melville said?…He said, ‘To produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme.’” Snoopy ponders for a moment and then begins typing, “The Dog. ”</p>
<p class="para">The difficulty of reading <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> arises as a common theme. In 2001, Jerry Scott and Jim Borgman’s <span class="italic">Zits</span> comic strip ran a series on that theme. In the first strip, the teenager Jeremy walks by with an enormous white whale strapped to his back. His friend asks, “Don’t tell me you still haven’t finished Moby Dick?!” A couple of strips later, Jeremy is reading, “Call me Ishmael.” He thinks to himself, “Call me bored out of my skull,” as his mother asks, “Ooh! Moby Dick! What chapter are you on?” Finally, Jeremy dreams of himself lashed to the back of a white whale, just as Gregory Peck is at the end of the 1956 film. His father says to his mother, “This summer’s reading list seems to be taking its toll on Jeremy,” but she responds by yelling at her son, “For <a id="page687"/>Pete’s sake, it’s just <span class="italic">Moby Dick</span>! Quit whining and start reading!” to which Jeremy responds, “Groan!” The young boy in Ray Billingsley’s comic strip <span class="italic">Curtis</span> also faces difficulty reading Melville’s book. His teacher asks, “And the answer <span class="italic">is</span>, Mr. Wilkins? ” to which he replies, “Um…I dunno, Mrs. Nelson!” He mutters, “The world is turning more and more to technology, and yet here we sit studying a stupid story about a stupid captain, and his stupid obsession with a stupid white whale!…” The boy looks up to see his teacher staring at him and asks, “<span class="italic">OH!</span> Did I say that out loud?” (2002). In 1993, the John McPherson strip <span class="italic">Close to Home</span> showed a female student holding a pencil and paper: “Page 1: 1st Draft: An Analysis of <span class="underline">Moby</span> <span class="underline">Dick</span> Herman 1 Melville’s 2 novel 3 <span class="underline">Moby</span> 4 <span class="underline">Dick</span> 5 takes 6 the 7 reader 8 on 9 a 10 wild 11 sea 12 adventure 13. Basically 14, it’s 15 about 16 this 17 guy 18, Ahab 19, who 20 is 21 really 22 mad 23 at 24 this 25 whale 26. ” The girl thinks to herself, “Shoot. 1,974 words to go!” and the caption reads: “Let’s face it. Everybody does this when they’re assigned a 2,000-word term paper. ” Finally, in 1995, Bill Amend’s <span class="italic">Fox Trot</span> featured a whole series on <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>. In one strip, Peter asks, “Mom, which would be the better way to write a book report…to spend a little time reading the book and almost no time writing the essay…or to spend a little time on the essay and almost no time reading the book?” His mother replies, “How about putting in lots of time on each? ” to which Peter answers, “Let me clarify: a book report due in 2 hours.” His mother looks at the book and gasps, incredulous, “Moby Dick?!”</p>
<p class="para">One of the best of the <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> cartoons appeared in the <span class="italic">Wilson Library Bulletin</span> in December 1971. A whaleman, harpoon in hand, points to a white whale in the distance, but his captain tells him, “Let it go. I don’t want to get mixed up in any damn allegory. ”</p>
<p class="para">What all these cartoons and comic strips have in common is the assumption that the reader will recognize the title <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, will understand that the book is at its most basic a story of conflict between a man with a peg leg and the white whale who bit it off, will know that the book is very long, and will be familiar with the first line, “Call me Ishmael.”</p>
<p class="para">In <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>, Melville includes three chapters on artistic depictions of whales. He entitled the third: “Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains; in Stars” (294). <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> in popular culture could be illustrated the same way: <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> in books, in film, in television, in cartoons—and now in kitsch, in Christmas ornaments, on businesses. <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span> kitsch abounds. The November 21, 1988, issue of the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> included a Gahan Wilson cartoon that pokes fun at this ubiquity. Melville walks down a city street with his wife and child. His wife wears a white whale hat, white whale slippers, and a white whale scarf and ear-rings. The baby sits in a white <a id="page688"/>whale shaped carriage with a white whale cap holding a white whale stuffed animal. A small boy in a similar cap tugs a white whale pull toy. A woman walks by with a white whale shaped purse and white whale glasses while in the background a man in yet another white whale cap eats a whale-shaped fish burger. The caption reads: “Herman Melville Wonders If His Agent Has Oversold Spinoffs from ‘Moby Dick.’” White whale Christmas ornaments come in all shapes and sizes and are made from every kind of material, including scallop and spider crab shells. And the name Moby Dick proudly adorns many businesses, most especially—as one might imagine—fish restaurants and take-out stands.</p>
<p class="para">Perhaps Melville’s ironic sense of humor would be tickled at this evidence of universality derived from his book contemplating “the universal problem of all things” (319).</p>
